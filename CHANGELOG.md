# Changelog

Full release notes. The README keeps a one-line summary per version; the detail lives here.

## v0.31.2 (2026-07-23) — fix: capture-health false negative on an agent's first-ever import

- **Fix: `_health.captured` now reads true on a surface's very first import, same run.**
  `_record_health`'s `captured` set is snapshotted from `ledger.calls(root)` **before**
  `run_agent` appends this run's newly-imported rows — a snapshot-ordering off-by-one that
  left a brand-new agent's very first import reading `captured:false` until a *second* import
  self-healed it. `run_agent` now records the row count it imported this run
  (`health[agent]["imported"]`), and `_record_health` unions that against the lifetime
  `captured` set (`a in captured or info.get("imported", 0) > 0`). New regression test:
  `test_first_ever_import_marks_the_agent_captured_same_run`
  ([tests/test_capture_health.py](tests/test_capture_health.py)), confirmed failing before the
  fix and passing after; verified against a real ledger (one `cage import` flipped all four
  surfaces to `captured:true`).
- **Correction to the 2026-07-22 regression report's F2 finding.** That report's stated root
  cause — "`captured` tracks this-run delta, not lifetime" — didn't match the code, which has
  read the lifetime `ledger.calls(root)` set since v0.30.0. The real defect and the corrected
  blast radius (this never produced a false "installed but capturing nothing" warning) are
  documented in [docs/regression/2026-07-23-f2-correction.md](docs/regression/2026-07-23-f2-correction.md)
  — a new dated entry per this repo's never-rewrite-history convention; the 07-22 report is
  unchanged.
- **New Must-Know Rule:** every `docs/*.prompt.md` must declare the model tier that should
  execute it (`**Model:**` line + one-line reason), with a Haiku/Sonnet/Opus rubric.

## v0.31.1 (2026-07-21) — docs: the Phase 2 field gate, made runnable

Documentation and repo-hygiene only — **no code changed**; the runtime is byte-identical to
v0.31.0 (same 814 tests, same derived numbers). This release ships the paperwork the v0.31.0
capture-architecture Phase 1 left in the working tree, so the Phase 2 waiting period is
measurable instead of prose.

- **The Phase 2 field gate is now a runnable procedure, not a sentence.**
  [docs/phase2-field-gate.md](docs/phase2-field-gate.md) turns the handoff §10 gate into a
  concrete comparison: build a hooks-on ledger and a hooks-off (`CAGE_CAPTURE_ON_READ`-only)
  ledger over the same span of work, compare them **by row id** (`mergeutil.union_by_id`
  semantics), and pass **iff** capture-on-read's row set is a **superset** of the hooks-on set
  — no row that only the hooks caught. References the exact switches (`CAGE_CAPTURE`,
  `CAGE_CAPTURE_ON_READ`, `--no-import`) and the `importcmd.ensure_captured` path. It is an
  acceptance test, not a runner — no `cage/**` code, no Phase 2 work. Linked from the handoff
  §10 and `docs/README.md` Active work.
- **Phase 2 decisions record.** `docs/capture-architecture.handoff.md` gained §9.7 (the
  verified Phase 2 change-map) and §10 (five resolved decisions plus the field gate), so the
  Phase 2 branch can be written later against fixed decisions rather than re-derived.
- **Repo hygiene.** `.gitignore` now ignores the regenerable `graphify-out/` tree in full (the
  prior partial rule left ~7MB unignored) and the machine-local `.claude/settings.local.json`.

Built from: [docs/capture-architecture.handoff.md](docs/capture-architecture.handoff.md) §9.7+§10
and [docs/phase2-field-gate.md](docs/phase2-field-gate.md). Phase 2 itself is unshipped — the
capture-architecture handoff/prompt/plan pairs stay **active in `docs/`**, not archived.

## v0.31.0 (2026-07-19) — capture-on-read: capture without hooks, made visible

Built from: [docs/capture-architecture.handoff.md](docs/capture-architecture.handoff.md) ·
[docs/capture-architecture.prompt.md](docs/capture-architecture.prompt.md) — **Phase 1** of
the phased [docs/capture-architecture.plan.md](docs/capture-architecture.plan.md) (Phase 2,
which deletes the token-capture hooks, is a separate later release; the docs stay active in
`docs/` until it ships). Additive — **no hook file or wiring module was touched**.

Capture no longer depends on a hook firing. **Every read that matters — `cage report`,
`cage insights *`, and the MCP read tools — lazily runs the incremental import sweep before
it answers**, so a number is never staler than the instant it's shown. No daemon, no
scheduler (the "cage installs no scheduler" invariant holds), no project required. The
sweep is throttled on the existing `_last_import` cursor (~60s, policy `[capture]
read_throttle_secs`), so back-to-back reads don't re-sweep; a warm cache is a `stat` per
source file. Fail-open: a capture error is traced under `CAGE_DEBUG` and never blocks a read.

- **One canonical ledger for push and pull.** `paths.canonical_ledger()` is the single
  resolver both the push path (graphify/fux/proxy `record_receipt`/`record_call`) and every
  read call — no direct `resolve_root` left in a push path, and every resolution is traced
  under `CAGE_DEBUG` ("which ledger + why"). A pushed receipt now carries a **non-PII project
  routing key** — a hash of the resolved ledger-root path (never the basename), OS-stable,
  additive/optional (absent = the legacy row, never part of any id). A project read
  **reclaims** a stray graphify/fux saving (one pushed to the global `~/.cage` because the
  tool ran outside the tree) by **exact key match only** — never a blind global→project
  union that would over-attribute two repos sharing a basename.
- **Capture is now visible.** A `graphify`/`fux` saving prints one `✔ cage: graphify saving
  captured — ~N tokens` line to **stderr** (never stdout — the tool's parseable output stays
  clean). A read that captures new rows prints `· captured N new calls (claude, codex) + M
  graphify savings since last read` (also stderr; **zero new ⇒ silent**). The MCP read tools
  return the same summary as a **structured field**, never stray stdout. `cage doctor` gains
  a **per-source, per-mode (pull/push) capture timeline** — and deliberately does **not**
  sweep first, so it never masks the breakage it diagnoses. `--why-ledger` prints the
  resolution decision on demand; `--quiet` / `CAGE_QUIET=1` silences the confirmations.
- **Suppressible and deterministic.** `--no-import` (this read), `CAGE_CAPTURE_ON_READ=0`
  (standing), or `CAGE_CAPTURE=0` (all capture) turn it off. Derived numbers stay a pure
  function of the ledger — capture-on-read changes *when* rows arrive, never how a number is
  computed — and the golden/determinism suites run with it **off** against a fixed ledger, so
  a warm read is byte-identical to before. CSV never gates: no confirmation text ever enters
  a CSV stream.
- **Prerequisite refactors (reviewable first commit).** `hooks.append_new` — the documented
  "correctness backstop" — moved to `ledger.py` (the universal import path must not depend on
  the Claude-specific hook module; a re-export shim keeps `hooks.append_new` working). The
  `cage doctor` "never imported" message was rewritten: under capture-on-read an empty
  capture-health record means capture is **off or errored**, not "you haven't run `cage
  import`".

## v0.30.0 (2026-07-16) — capture health: make silent zero-capture loud

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.30-capture-health.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.30-capture-health.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.30-capture-health.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.30-capture-health.prompt.md).

When an agent is **installed but its log source matched nothing**, cage now says so —
instead of quietly capturing zero and printing confident totals from the agents that
still work. A wrong path (a vendor moved its store, a nonstandard install, the
`UNVERIFIED-LAYOUT` Windows Kiro path) produces zero rows, which used to be
indistinguishable from "I don't use that agent." Now `cage report` and `cage doctor`
carry a footer warning:

```
⚠ codex: ~/.codex exists but ~/.codex/sessions matched 0 files — capture is off for this agent.
  cage doctor --paths      (if you don't use codex: [sources.codex] replace=true, paths=[] )
```

- **Triple-gated so it can never become a false-positive nag.** It fires for an agent
  only when **all three** hold: its home marker exists, its log matched **0 files** at
  the last import, and it has **never contributed a row** to the ledger. The third
  clause makes it **self-silencing** — one captured row and it can never warn again, so
  it only ever names an agent that is genuinely capturing nothing.
- **Self-healing.** Fix the path (or the agent starts writing logs) → the next import
  rewrites the verdict and the warning clears, no other action.
- **Opt-out reuses the existing knob.** An agent you don't use, declared
  `[sources.<agent>] replace = true, paths = []` (already "disabled by policy"), stays
  silent — no new config key.
- **No new I/O on any read path.** The gate inputs are recorded at import time into
  `cursors.json["_health"]` (from facts the scan + the one shared ledger read already
  compute — zero extra reads) and rendered from that cache. `cage report`'s
  **render stays a pure function of its arguments**; its tables are byte-identical and
  the warning **never enters CSV**. No new state file (rides beside `_last_import` in
  the cursor map, cleanup-safe).
- `cage doctor` surfaces the same verdict (a fresh install with no import yet just says
  "never imported — run `cage import`"; no live probe).

## v0.29.0 (2026-07-16) — visible source paths + per-source globs

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.29-sources-defaults.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.29-sources-defaults.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.29-sources-defaults.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.29-sources-defaults.prompt.md) —
Phase 4 follow-on of [docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md](docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md).

Two independent pieces, one release. Both **capture-side only** — no derived view
changes by one byte, determinism untouched, and an empty/absent `[sources]` stays
byte-identical to the built-in registry.

- **Per-source `glob` (the real capability gap).** A `[sources.<agent>]` entry may
  now declare its own filename pattern: `glob = "usage-*.ndjson"`. Absent ⇒ the
  format's canonical glob (unchanged); an empty `glob = ""` is an **error**, never a
  silent fallback. A glob character (`*?[`) in a `path` is still rejected — but the
  message now **names the fix** ("put the pattern in `glob = `"). This makes a tool
  whose layout isn't the canonical shape capturable at all.
- **Array-of-tables form.** `[[sources.<agent>]]` with one `{path, glob?}` block per
  location — a per-path glob, vs. the table form's one `glob` for every `path`.
  `resolve_log_sources` branches on the parsed TOML type (dict ⇒ legacy table, list ⇒
  array); **different agents may use different shapes in one file**. A custom tool in
  array form carries `format` on each entry.
- **`cage doctor --paths`** shows the declared glob per source (it already rendered
  the pattern column — now it reflects your `glob`).
- **A generated, commented `[sources]` block in the bundled `policy.toml`.** The
  built-in defaults (paths, globs, redirect env vars, per-OS locations, the Windows
  Kiro `UNVERIFIED-LAYOUT` label) are now **visible in every project's
  `.cage/policy.toml`** — as a comment block between `# cage:sources-start` /
  `# cage:sources-end`, regenerated by `tools/docgen --target policy` from
  `paths.builtin_source_docs()` and drift-gated in CI. **Every line is a comment**, so
  `tomllib` sees no `sources` key, capture resolves the built-ins byte-for-byte, and
  `policy sync` still has nothing to touch. The defaults live in code and upgrade with
  the package; uncommenting a block into a real table is an **explicit pin**. The block
  is emitted `~`-relative and env-independent, so it is identical bytes on every
  machine.

Design note: an *active* `[sources]` default in the bundle was deliberately **not**
built — `initcmd` copies the bundle verbatim, `policy.load` lets a project table
shadow it, and `policysync` skips `sources`, so a shipped active default could never
be fixed for an existing project (silent zero capture). The commented block delivers
the visibility with none of that freeze risk. See the handoff for the full debate.

`tools/docgen`'s `policy` target now owns two regions of the bundled file (the
`# formula:` comment lines and the `[sources]` sentinel block); `docgen --check`
gates drift on both.

## v0.28.0 (2026-07-15) — configurable import paths: `[sources]` in policy.toml

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.28-policy-sources.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.28-policy-sources.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.28-policy-sources.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.28-policy-sources.prompt.md) —
Phase 4 of [docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md](docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md).

**This release also ships the previously-unreleased v0.26.0 (output honesty) and
v0.27.0 (CLI tiering) work** — the three phases were developed as one stack and cut
as a single release; their full notes are the two entries below.

A `[sources]` policy table that adds — or replaces — the log locations `cage
import` probes: one or more paths per agent, plus custom tools that reuse a
declared parser format. For a nonstandard install, a network home, a side-by-side
log copy, or an in-house emitter that writes an already-supported format. **Additive
by construction — an empty or absent `[sources]` is byte-identical to the built-in
registry**, so capture is unchanged for everyone who doesn't use it. Capture-side
only: no derived view changes, determinism untouched.

- **Schema.** `[sources.<agent>] paths = ["~/…", "$VAR/…"]` extends one of the four
  agents (claude · codex · copilot · kiro); `replace = true` drops that agent's
  built-ins first (empty `paths` ⇒ **disabled by policy** — a clean way to silence a
  never-installed agent's probe). A custom tool is any table whose name is *not* one
  of the four agents: it must declare `format = "claude|codex|copilot|kiro"` (the
  parser to reuse) and its rows import with `agent = <name>`, so `cage report` /
  `cage insights attrib` split it out. `~`/`$VAR` expand; a glob-shaped entry
  (`*?[`) is rejected. New log *formats* stay out of scope by construction.
- **One resolution point.** `paths.resolve_log_sources(pol)` returns the
  provenance-tagged candidate list the import sweep **and** `cage doctor --paths`
  both consume — no second resolver. Precedence: **env home override > policy
  `[sources]` > built-in registry**; a policy path equal to a built-in path is
  deduped to the built-in tag.
- **Same capture contract.** Policy paths sweep with the same incremental cursors
  (keyed on each resolved file path), the same id-dedupe, and the same per-file
  fail-open (a missing/unreadable path is a debug-logged skip, never an error) as the
  built-ins. `cage data export`'s import-first sweep includes them; `CAGE_CAPTURE=0`
  disables them with everything else.
- **`cage doctor --paths`.** Every candidate now names its **provenance** —
  `built-in | env | policy` — custom tools appear as their own sections, a
  `disabled by policy` label shows a replace+empty agent, cross-agent path overlaps
  are flagged, and a **committed project policy** carrying a machine-absolute source
  path warns ("teammates' clones will probe a path that doesn't exist — move it to
  ~/.cage/policy.toml or use ~/…"). A `~`/`$VAR` path and the global `~/.cage`
  policy are exempt. Malformed entries render as loud `⚠ ignored:` lines.
- **`cage query sources`.** A new concept entry: the schema, precedence, portability
  rule, and your **live resolved sources**.
- **`policy sync` ownership.** `[sources]` is entirely user-owned — the bundled
  `policy.toml` ships none — so `cage policy sync` never adds, updates, or
  orphan-warns it (asserted by test).
- **Docs.** New [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md) (indexed) + a README capture
  one-liner. Two must-never-skip tests: empty-`[sources]` byte-identity and the full
  env>policy>built-in precedence matrix; plus expansion, custom-tool end-to-end
  (fixture log at a policy path → rows split by the tool name), cursor
  incrementality, portability warn/no-warn, and sync ownership. Dummyrepo **S15**.

## v0.27.0 (shipped in v0.28.0, 2026-07-15) — CLI tiering: five daily verbs, grouped rooms, a clean pre-1.0 verb break

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.27-cli-tiering.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.27-cli-tiering.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.27-cli-tiering.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.27-cli-tiering.prompt.md) —
Phase 3 of [docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md](docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md).

**⚠ BREAKING — this release removes ~30 top-level verbs and regroups them.** The
daily loop is five verbs; everything else is one group deep. Nothing lost from
*capability* — only from the front door. For one release, an old verb name errors
with a direction (`error: 'attrib' is now 'cage insights attrib'`, exit 1) instead
of running; it never silently aliases. Recorded ledgers, CSV/JSON schemas, MCP tool
names, and `hook-*` plumbing are untouched — only the CLI door moved.

- **Tier-1 front door.** `cage --help` now renders five daily verbs
  (`report` · `import` · `setup` · `doctor` · `query`) + seven group names, one
  screen, no usage/options noise. Bare `cage` still prints the overview.
- **Groups (run any group name for its commands).**
  `cage insights <attrib|matrix|roi|verdict|budget|compare|estimate|calibration|trend|why|forecast|regression|recommend>` ·
  `cage human <show|record|outcome|quality>` ·
  `cage authorship <origin|verify|notes-sync|ledger-sync>` ·
  `cage data <export|cleanup|limits|watch|serve|proxy|meter|graphify>`.
  `prices`/`study`/`policy` are unchanged. Group subcommands keep their exact
  flags and output — behavior is frozen (proven by an old-vs-new golden byte-diff
  per verb; the only diffs are the usage/program line and renamed hint strings).
- **`init` merged into `setup`.** `cage init` is gone; `cage setup` scaffolds
  `.cage/` unconditionally as step one, then wires. `cage setup --global` unchanged.
- **Hidden but callable.** `mcp` (spawned by wired configs), `debug` (diagnostic),
  `demo` (README-referenced), `graphify` (interceptor seam, under `data`), and the
  `hook-*` entrypoints stay callable — just off `cage --help`.
- **Seams migrated.** The graphify interceptor shim now routes through
  `cage data graphify`; re-running `cage setup` migrates a committed Claude
  SessionStart hook from the removed `import-claude` to `import --agent claude`
  (grep-tested like portable wiring). No argparse prefix-matching — an old
  abbreviation is an invalid choice, not a silent hit.
- **World regenerated.** All four agents' skill/prompt/steering assets, the
  `cage query` concept text, `docs/formulas.md`, the bundled `policy.toml` comments,
  and every emitted hint string now name the grouped verbs (a `render.cmd()` helper
  centralizes the spelling); a grep gate proves zero stale `cage <old-verb>` in
  source, rendered assets, or committed wiring.

**Old → new verb map** (the removed-verb error handler and this table are both
generated from `cage/verbmap.py`):

| removed verb | now |
| --- | --- |
| `cage init` | `cage setup` |
| `cage import-codex` | `cage import --agent codex` |

## v0.26.0 (shipped in v0.28.0, 2026-07-15) — output honesty: tokens by default, `—` for unpriced, signal-gated columns, generated docs

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.26-output-honesty.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.26-output-honesty.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.26-output-honesty.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.26-output-honesty.prompt.md) —
plan Phases 1+2+5.6 of
[docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md](docs/output-and-simplification.plan.md).

**⚠ This release deliberately changes the rendered text of most read views in
one go** — driven by field output where `saved $0.0000 / net -$16.11` rendered
in a receipt-less project and `$0.0000` meant "couldn't price". Every new
rendering is pinned by a golden test and documented in
[docs/cli-output-spec.md](docs/cli-output-spec.md) (now generated from those
same goldens). **CSV schemas and values are byte-frozen** — if you scripted
against `--csv` or `--json`, nothing moved; if you scraped the text tables,
read on.

- **Tokens by default; dollars opt-in (plan Phase 2.5).** `cage report` (every
  `--by` view), `cage matrix`, and the bare `cage` headline render tokens-only
  until asked for currency: per-invocation `--usd` > env `CAGE_USD` > policy
  `[display] usd = true` (new bundled section; `policy_version` bumped —
  `cage policy sync` carries it into projects). Pricing footnotes
  (family/alias/ladder-rung) and the full ⚠ UNPRICED block render only in the
  `--usd` view; the token view carries one muted pointer (`· N calls unpriced —
  matters when you view $`). Money-native views (`budget`, `roi`, `verdict`,
  `compare`, `estimate`, `human`, `trend`) keep dollars unconditionally.
  Pricing always computes underneath — budget guards and UNPRICED detection
  are display-independent.
- **`—` is the only rendering of "couldn't price".** A group whose every call
  refused to price shows `—`, never `$0.0000`; the TOTAL carries
  `(+ unpriced)`; a net over a dashed cost is itself `—`; roi/attrib rows whose
  receipts all refused the ladder dash their $ cells. `$0.0000` now always
  means a real zero. CSV keeps explicit empty + `priced_via=none` — the glyph
  never enters data. The report's ⚠ block now prints one **runnable fix line
  per unpriced model** (the `cage prices unpriced` builder, one wording).
- **Signal-gated saved/net (plan Phase 2.1).** saved/net (and the token view's
  `saved tok`) columns render only when ≥1 savings receipt exists in the
  window; otherwise the table is spend-only plus one line pointing at
  `cage query receipts`. `--all-columns` restores the fixed shape. **Hard
  line, tested by name: a negative net with real receipts renders
  unconditionally** (`test_negative_net_with_receipts_always_renders`).
- **Matrix: the token grid always renders (spec I7/I8).** The old whole-view
  `$0→$0` table and the unpriced-model refusal are both gone: the default is a
  token grid; `--usd` adds the cost column when a model prices (task join, or
  a unanimous `[tools.<tool>] price_at` route — matrix is now a ladder
  consumer) and otherwise appends one line naming the reason plus a runnable
  fix. `--human` implies `--usd` (the anchor is a dollar row).
- **Tidiness (plan Phase 1).** 0-call receipt-only bucket rows never render
  (their savings stay in TOTAL); footnotes/⚠/advice dedupe to one each in a
  fixed bottom order (the new `cage/display.py` Footer — one implementation,
  no per-view copies); the kiro input-only caveat renders once, per-view
  wording (`tok out not recorded` / `cost understated`); `last import: N ago`
  is staleness-gated (`[capture] import_stale_hours`, default
  `constants.IMPORT_STALE_HOURS` = 24; `0` restores always-on); the generic
  kiro model bucket renders `agent (kiro)`; the empty ledger prints next-step
  lines (`cage import` / `cage doctor`), and an empty *filtered slice* names
  the active filters instead of pretending the ledger is empty (the `--scope`
  papercut).
- **Three generated doc surfaces with CI drift gates (plan Phase 5.6,
  `tools/docgen` — build-time, stdlib, never in the wheel).**
  `docs/cli-output-spec.md` code blocks ← the golden fixtures
  (`tests/fixtures/goldens/`, asserted by `tests/test_output_spec.py`; status
  flipped to LIVE, README-linked beside the CSV contracts) ·
  `docs/formulas.md` ← the `explain_data.py` calculation registry (every
  calculation entry must be catalogued — the check fails otherwise; three
  pricing entries and trend/budget added) · bundled policy.toml `# formula:`
  comments ← the same registry. `python -m tools.docgen --check` runs in CI
  beside skillgen's; `tests/test_docgen.py` gates it locally too.
- **Goldens.** 30 byte-pinned fixtures across report/overview/matrix/verdict/
  compare/estimate/prices/study/policy states; `study join`'s output is
  machine-dependent by design (wiring + doctor) so it is shape-asserted, not
  byte-pinned. `cage demo`'s matrix table re-pins once to the new rendering
  (same numbers, new shape).
- **Query surface.** New `display` concept entry (`cage query display`);
  `unpriced` teaches the `—` convention and the `--usd` placement; skill/
  prompt/steering assets regenerated (they teach `--usd` and the gating).

Breaking (text only): scripts parsing `cage report`/`cage matrix`/bare-`cage`
text output must add `--usd` (or set `[display] usd = true`) to see dollar
columns; the empty-ledger message changed; the report title separator is now
`·`. Use `--csv`/`--json` for stable machine surfaces — that's what they're
for.

## v0.25.0 (2026-07-14) — policy sync: upgrade a project policy.toml to the installed bundle

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.25-policy-sync.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.25-policy-sync.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.25-policy-sync.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.25-policy-sync.prompt.md)

A project inited at v0.16 has a policy.toml missing everything the bundle
gained since (`[meta]`, `[cleanup]`, `capture.import_before_export`).
`policy.load` defaults them all, so nothing breaks — but the user never
*discovers* tunables, and a stale un-customized default can drift from the
bundle's improved one. `cage prices sync` solved exactly this for pricing
tables; **`cage policy sync` generalizes it to the whole file** (plan §3.10).

- **`cage policy sync`** — dry-run categorized diff (the default surface;
  `cage policy diff` is the same view by name). Four categories with counts:
  **add** (in the bundle, missing here → `--apply` writes bundled defaults as
  plain text with one provenance comment `# added by cage policy sync (vX.Y)`
  — never into the managed block, never `# cage:custom`-marked, so a synced
  default stays sync-updatable), **update** (equal to a recorded *old*
  default whose bundled value changed → refreshed, old→new shown), **keep**
  (customized — structurally owned, or differing where no default ever
  changed: the user's edit, never touched), **orphan** (the bundle dropped it
  → warned with version context, never deleted). A user's own sections are
  invisible to sync entirely.
- **The versioned-defaults record** (`policysync.DEFAULT_CHANGES` /
  `REMOVED_KEYS`) — empty today, and empty is load-bearing: no non-pricing
  default has ever changed (verified against the git history of
  `data/policy.toml`), so a differing un-marked value can only be the user's
  edit — classified *keep*, never clobber-able drift. Where a default *does*
  change someday and the file predates `policy_version`, the row falls to a
  per-key confirm bucket (`--yes section.key` / `--yes all`) — honest over
  clever, the prices-sync stance. Maintenance rule documented in the module:
  a release changing/removing a bundled non-pricing default appends the old
  value and bumps `[meta] policy_version`.
- **`[meta] policy_version`** — new bundled key (compared as a version
  *tuple*, not a date), stamped by `cage init` (verbatim copy) and restamped
  on every `--apply` — but only once the confirm bucket is decided: stamping
  earlier would re-era the file and silently reclassify pending rows as
  customized. `prices_version` is never touched by policy sync.
- **Two safety invariants, tested and scenario-verified:**
  behavior-neutrality (zero-customization project: `--apply` then every
  derived view — report/attrib/budget/human/trend/matrix — byte-identical:
  adds only pin defaults `policy.load` was already merging in) and idempotent
  apply (second `--apply` is a byte-identical no-op, "already in sync").
- **One merge brain per family:** `[prices]`/`[credits]`/`[alias]` and
  `[tools.<name>]` routes are never diffed here — the `cage prices sync`
  summary embeds in the output, and `--apply` never touches a pricing row.
  The scalar `[tools] order` pipeline key *is* policy and syncs here.
- **Hints split by drift kind:** doctor gains a `policy-version` check and the
  post-commit note carries the `cage policy sync` recommendation
  (`freshness.policy_line`, opt-in) — but the `cage report` footer never
  does: price drift can make the report's *dollars* stale; policy drift
  changes no derived number. Pure price drift keeps the `cage prices sync`
  hint verbatim. Nothing anywhere auto-applies either sync.
- **Writer extensions, not forks** (`pricestoml`): `add_table` (plain-text
  append outside the managed block, provenance comment, idempotent),
  `set_table(..., mark_custom=False)` (a refreshed default must not start
  reading as user-owned), list values in `_fmt_value` (`[tools] order`).
  Same lock + re-parse + temp-write/atomic-replace: exotic TOML refuses per
  file with a typed `CageError`, never a mangled write; git-tracked policies
  get a "review with git; no .bak files" note.
- `cage init` prints a one-time pointer (new tunables ship in future versions
  — `cage policy sync` shows them); `cage query policy-sync` explains the
  categories + neutrality invariant with live version stamps; dummyrepo
  **S16** drives the whole arc end-to-end (strip to v0.16 shape → exact
  categories → neutral apply → no-op second apply → hints flip clean).

New: `cage/policysync.py`, `policy` CLI group, doctor `policy-version`,
`freshness.policy_line`, `cage query policy-sync`, dummyrepo S16,
`[meta] policy_version = "0.25.0"`. 34 new tests (657 passing).

## v0.24.0 (2026-07-14) — pricing freshness: the per-commit staleness note + complete vendor tables

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.24-pricing-freshness.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.24-pricing-freshness.handoff.md) ·
[docs/archive/v0.24-pricing-freshness.prompt.md](docs/archive/v0.24-pricing-freshness.prompt.md)

Pricing is derive-time, so a stale price table quietly mis-prices *all* history —
and nothing checked freshness at the moment work is committed, or watched the
bundle's own age (a project faithfully synced to a six-month-old bundle was
confidently stale). cage never fetches a rate (no network on any cage code
path), so the answer is **three local signals, one implementation, three
surfaces** (`cage/freshness.py`):

1. **sync drift** — project `[meta]` older than the installed bundle →
   the existing `cage prices sync` recommendation, verbatim.
2. **bundle age** — the bundle's own `[meta] prices_date` more than
   `stale_days` old → `bundled prices are N days old — check for a newer cage
   release`. Threshold: policy `[prices] stale_days`
   (`constants.PRICES_STALE_DAYS` fallback, 45; `0` disables — documented
   opt-out).
3. **UNPRICED presence** — calls / call-less token receipts billing $0 → the
   existing runnable fix hints, byte-for-byte (never re-phrased).

Surfaces: the **git post-commit hook** prints the actionable lines
(`cage:`-prefixed headline, print-only, fail-open, exit 0, silent when clean —
never gates a commit; its own swallow-site, `hook.post_commit.freshness`,
debug-logged and audit-tested); **`cage doctor`** gains a `prices-age` check
beside `prices-meta`/`pricing` (all three signals now render there); the
**`cage report` footer** appends actionable lines only — and, determinism law:
the footer's age math anchors on the **newest ledger `ts`** (data-relative,
clock-free; byte-identical across runs on the same ledger; empty ledger ⇒
report silent, doctor carries the age), while hook/doctor use wall-clock
today. Never in `--csv` (CSV consumers get the UNPRICED columns already).
`cage query prices-freshness` explains with live values.

**Complete Anthropic + OpenAI tables** (build-time research, every row cited
`# source: URL (retrieved 2026-07-14)`): 24 new rows — Anthropic recent-history
(`claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-3-7-sonnet`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`,
`claude-3-5-haiku` legacy-order twin, `claude-3-opus`, `claude-3-sonnet`,
`claude-3-haiku`; retired-but-billable in 2025–26 ledgers, so historical rows
keep repricing at what they actually billed) and OpenAI GA + recent-history
(`gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex` — the codex fixture id,
now exact — `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5-codex`,
`gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-pro`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`,
`gpt-4o-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`, `codex-mini-latest`). Every
anthropic/openai id in the fixture corpus now exact- or family-matches
(tested: zero `none`). `[meta]` bumped to 2026-07-14.

**Maintainer-side CI nag** (`.github/workflows/prices-freshness-nag.yml`, new
file — publish workflow untouched): weekly cron reads the bundled
`prices_date` with stdlib and, past `stale_days`, upserts ONE pinned issue
("bundled prices are N days old — re-verify against the cited sources") —
reopens if human-closed, never duplicates, never fetches a vendor page (a
wrong auto-parsed rate is the worst outcome; the workflow nags a human).

Also fixed: a scalar key under `[prices]` (e.g. `stale_days`, or any user
typo) crashed `prices list`/`prices sync` provider iteration — the sites now
skip non-table values (regression-tested).

New: `cage/freshness.py` · `ledger.newest_ts` · `policy.prices_stale_days` ·
doctor `prices-age` · `cage query prices-freshness` · dummyrepo S15 (backdated
meta → post-commit note; sync silences; data-relative 100-day footer exact +
byte-identical; `stale_days = 0` opt-out) · 22 new tests (623 passing).

## v0.23.0 (2026-07-14) — tool-receipt pricing: dollars for call-less token receipts

Built from: [docs/archive/v0.23-tool-receipt-pricing.handoff.md](docs/archive/v0.23-tool-receipt-pricing.handoff.md) ·

Graphify's interceptor and fux-style shims file token-savings receipts with a
`task` but **no call id** — the saved tokens belong to future calls the shim
can't know. Those receipts rendered tokens but priced $0. They now resolve a
model at derive time via a deterministic **pricing ladder**
(`cage/receiptprice.py`, one implementation for every consumer):

1. **`[tools.<tool>] price_at = "provider/model"`** — explicit policy routing,
   written by the managed verb **`cage prices route-tool <tool> --to
   <provider>/<model>`** (`--remove` deletes; idempotent, before/after printed,
   bundled policy untouched — completes the debated spec's rung-1 surface).
   Validated against `policy.price_match` at use time: a dangling target
   *writes with a warning* (set-route-then-add-price works; unlike `alias`,
   which refuses), prices nothing, and never falls through (the dangling-alias
   rule); `cage prices list` and `cage doctor` flag it.
2. **task model** — the dominant model of the calls joined to the receipt's
   task (task-id + session-window calls, the `taskgroup` join): max summed
   `tokens_in`, ties → call count → lexicographic `provider/model` (a total
   order, tested).
3. **refusal** — UNPRICED, loudly: `roi` and `report` print the ⚠ headline
   plus one **runnable** fix line per affected tool — `run: cage prices
   route-tool <tool> --to <provider>/<model>  (or run in a metered session)` —
   with the real tool name substituted (the fix-hint contract, tested
   literally: copy the line, substitute the target, run it, dollars appear).

Method law holds: the USD keeps the receipt's own `method` (`modeled`, never
upgraded); the rung is footnoted in `roi`/`attrib` text (`≈ graphify priced at
task model (anthropic/…)`), named by `cage verdict <tool>`, and is a
`priced_via` column in `roi`/`attrib` CSV. A receipt whose call id doesn't
resolve (a fleet bundle missing that call) enters the ladder instead of
silently pricing $0.

**Historical derived numbers change (that's the feature):** ledgers with
call-less token receipts now show non-zero dollars in `roi`, `attrib`,
`verdict`, `report --by task/agent` saved columns, and the bare-`cage`
overview. Receipts with a resolvable call id — and `cage demo`'s §4.4
tables — are byte-identical to before. Derive-time only: no ledger row is
ever written or rewritten, so setting `price_at` re-prices history.

Also: `cage query receipt-pricing` explains the ladder with live policy
values; `docs/pricing.md` gains the "Tool receipts" section; plan §4.5 notes
the shape; dummyrepo scenario S14 sets its route via the verb and exercises
all three rungs + the tie-break end-to-end through the CLI. Routes are user
intent: the bundled policy ships none (tested) and `prices sync` never
touches them; a hand-added `[tools.<tool>]` table is edited in place with a
`# cage:custom` mark, exactly like `prices set`.

## v0.22.2 (2026-07-12) — capture correctness: three bugs from the v0.22.1 full test run

The full sibling-repo test plan (`docs/full-test-plan-sibling-repo.md`) was executed
end-to-end against v0.22.1 — real Claude Code CLI + VS Code extension, Codex VS Code
extension, Copilot CLI + VS Code chat, and the Kiro IDE. All seven parts passed; the
run surfaced three capture-correctness bugs, all fixed here with regression tests.

- **Live-capture duplicate rows (hook race)** — a machine with both user-level
  (legacy) and project-level Claude hook wiring fires two `cage hook-*` processes per
  Stop/SessionEnd; both loaded the dedupe `seen` set before either write landed, so
  **every live turn was double-appended and live Claude spend double-counted**.
  `lockutil`'s docstring named exactly this scenario but the hook path never took the
  lock. `hooks._capture_calls` now wraps its read-check-append in
  `lockutil.locked(state/import.lock)` — the same lock the import path holds — fail-open
  with a `hook.capture.lock` debug line on a lock miss. Regression test drives a real
  cross-process interleave (verified fail-before/pass-after). One-shot imports were
  never affected (single writer under `import.lock`).
- **graphify double-metering** — graphify ≥ 0.5.0 natively files a cage receipt per
  query when `.cage/` exists, so `cage graphify -- …` (and the setup-installed
  `bin/graphify` interceptor) filed a second receipt for the same saving → roi/verdict
  inflated 2×. The wrapper now snapshots the ledger's graphify receipt ids before the
  child runs and defers when the child self-metered (one saving, one receipt); the
  child gets `CAGE_GRAPHIFY_METERED=1`, a forward handshake a graphify version can
  respect to skip its native receipt (task binding then returns to the wrapper). Old
  graphify versions keep the wrapper's task-bound receipt exactly as before.
- **`cage meter -- <cmd>` separator** — argparse REMAINDER keeps the `--`, so the
  documented form tried to exec `'--'` itself. The separator is now stripped
  (mirroring `cage graphify`); the child's exit code propagates as before.

Also in this release: the v0.22.1 run record is archived at
[docs/archive/v0.22.1-full-test-run.md](docs/archive/v0.22.1-full-test-run.md)
(58 findings rows: capture matrix per agent×surface, PII canary sweep, determinism
double-runs, offline sweep, portable-wiring clone-sim, launcher-mode round-trip,
zipapp parity, fleet study); the evergreen test plan gains the run's four drift
fixes (`--since <window>` not date; `cage outcome` has no `--ok` — success is the
default; export manifest wording; a network-denied sandbox as the Wi-Fi-off
equivalent); the reusable driver prompt is indexed under Operations
(`docs/cage-claude-code-prompt-full-test-run.md`). Suite: **574 tests passing**
(three new regression tests).

## v0.22.1 (2026-07-11) — docs lifecycle: the archive, the storybook spine, the rule

Docs-only release: `docs/` (41 loose files, most of them shipped-work exhaust) is restructured so a future reader — human or agent — can tell live spec from historical build instruction, and the discipline is made durable as a CLAUDE.md rule.

- **`docs/archive/`** — every shipped handoff/prompt/build-prompt (all of the old `docs/prompts/`, now removed, plus the root-level pairs) moved and renamed to sort by the release that shipped the work: `vX.Y-<feature>.{handoff,prompt}.md`, text verbatim plus a one-line "Archived — history, not spec" header. Superseded drafts (the ledger-scale plan amendment, the meter research pair, the dummy-repo trio) archived under the same convention; the applied `claude-md-proposal-*.md` trio deleted (verified applied; git history preserves them). Index: `docs/archive/README.md` (version · feature · handoff · prompt · CHANGELOG anchor, with explicit mapping notes where a version was ambiguous).
- **The storybook spine** — new `docs/README.md` (Start here → Subsystem design docs → Operations → Active work → Archive); CHANGELOG entries v0.16.0–v0.22.0 each gained a trailing "Built from: …" line linking their archived pair; `docs/full-test-plan-sibling-repo.md` reset to an evergreen template (`<version under test>` placeholder, boxes unticked) with the ticked v0.16.0 run record archived as `docs/archive/v0.16-full-test-run.md`.
- **The rule (CLAUDE.md, Must-Know Rules)** — handoff/prompt docs have a lifecycle: active in `docs/` root (listed under *Active work*) while unshipped; **the release that ships the work must, in the same change, move the pair to the archive, link it from the CHANGELOG entry, update both indexes, and promote any still-true design content into the living docs.** A shipped feature whose handoff/prompt still sits in `docs/` root is a release bug, same as a missing changelog entry. (This release dogfoods it: its own build prompt is archived below.)
- **README trimmed (307 → 235 lines), nothing lost** — the pricing wall-of-text became the new design doc `docs/pricing.md` (how a call prices · the unpriced workflow · policy versioning/`cage prices sync` · fleet repricing · the Copilot approximation · credits vs prices); the 44-line command listing, the Authorship section, and a third of Honest attribution now live behind links (`cage --help`, plan §3.5, plan §4). The keep-untouched sections (story, See it, Quickstart, agents table, `$0` guarantee) are byte-identical.
- Zero behavior change: comment/docstring path updates only (`tests/test_bundled_data.py`, `tools/buildpyz.py`, `tools/dummyrepo/run.py`); every relative link in README/CHANGELOG/CLAUDE.md/docs verified resolving; suite unchanged (569 passing), skillgen `--check` clean.

## v0.22.0 (2026-07-11) — restricted environments: python-launcher mode + cage.pyz (plan §5)

Cage as a first-class citizen on locked-down (finance/enterprise) endpoints where unknown exes are blocked (AppLocker/WDAC) or pip/PyPI is unreachable. Design of record: `docs/restricted-environments.md` (+ `docs/portable-wiring.md`, extended); handoff: `docs/archive/v0.22-restricted-env.handoff.md`.

- **Python-launcher wiring mode (opt-in)** — `cage setup --python-launcher` persists `[wiring] python_launcher = true` in project policy and (re)writes the shim pair + every user-level wired file (copilot hook, codex MCP, kiro MCP, git commit hooks) to resolve cage **through the interpreter only** (`python3 -m cage` / `py -3 -m cage`) — nothing exe-shaped is probed or executed, grep-tested. Committed files are unchanged (they reference the shim; the shim *is* the mode). Same fail-open exit-0 contract; plain `cage setup` re-runs preserve the persisted mode byte-identically; flip the key to `false` + re-run to revert. Mode-switch re-wiring collapses stale entries (`paths.cage_command_tail` now recognizes the interpreter forms); `cage doctor`'s portability check names the active mode and warns on policy↔shim drift.
- **`CAGE_RUN_PYTHON=1`** — runtime-only override on the **standard** shim: skips the exe probe and goes straight to the interpreter without rewiring (the standard shim texts changed once to carry the branch — behavior with the env unset is test-pinned identical, and the next `cage setup` rewrites the file).
- **`cage.pyz` release asset** — every GitHub release now also carries a single-file stdlib zipapp + `SHA256SUMS`, built and smoke-tested by CI (new `build-pyz` → `smoke-pyz` 3-OS matrix → `release-pyz` jobs on the same `release: published` trigger, fully independent of — and never touching — the PyPI trusted-publishing job). Run it as `py cage.pyz import/export/report`; the pyz story is pull-based capture — shims never embed a pyz path, hooks need an importable install. Local smoke build: `python -m tools.buildpyz` (`just pyz`); never attach from a laptop.
- **importlib.resources migration (the pyz prerequisite)** — all bundled-data reads go through the new `paths.bundled_data()` Traversable (`policy` default/prices, skill/prompt/steering asset copies, the graphify shim, doctor-bundle provenance display); wheel behavior byte-identical (tested), and every asset read is exercised over a real built pyz (`tests/test_zipapp.py`). `paths.bundled_data_dir()` is gone (repo-internal, 5 call sites).
- **Distribution honesty** — `cage --version` prints `cage X.Y.Z (zipapp)` under the pyz; `cage doctor`'s tool check labels the zipapp run and states the pull-based-capture posture instead of a spurious not-on-PATH warn.
- **Docs + query** — `docs/restricted-environments.md` (three tiers: launcher mode · pyz · internal mirror; the WDAC script-host caveat stated honestly; a first-endpoint validation checklist), README platforms link, `docs/portable-wiring.md` launcher-mode section, new `cage query restricted-env` concept + `portable-wiring` extended.
- Validation: launcher-mode grep contract + shim runtime + `CAGE_RUN_PYTHON` precedence + doctor mode/drift tests; bundled-data wheel byte-identity + full pyz asset/determinism suite; dummyrepo **S12** (launcher wiring end-to-end) and **S13** (pyz wheel↔zip report parity, `$CAGE_PYZ` reuses the exact CI artifact). +26 tests (543→569).

## v0.21.0 (2026-07-11) — CSV output + agent reporting recipes (plan §3.9)

CSV as a one-way **reporting** surface — never blurred with the re-importable fleet bundle (`cage export --study`, jsonl, merge-by-id), never an import source. Design of record: plan §3.9 + `docs/csv-output.md` (per-view column contracts).

- **`--csv` on the read views** — `report` · `attrib` · `roi` · `compare` · `study report` · `calibration` (incl. `--human`) · `human` · `trend`. Bare `--csv` streams to stdout (pipe-friendly; confirmations go to stderr), `--csv <path>` writes a file. One shared data structure per view feeds the text table AND the CSV (`render_csv` beside each `render_*`) — same numbers by construction, no view computes twice. New shared renderer `cage/csvout.py`: stdlib `csv`, RFC-4180 quoting, LF pinned on every OS (`lineterminator="\n"` + `newline=""` file writes), one canonical cell rendering (bool → `true`/`false`, floats trimmed fixed-point, lists `;`-joined, dicts as sorted JSON).
- **Honesty survives into the spreadsheet** — method/match tags are **columns** (`estimated` never silently drops; roi rows now carry the least-trusted receipt method, the attrib rule); compare deltas stay `estimated` with the observational caveat verbatim in a `note` column; min-n refusals keep the reason and **no numbers**; the UNPRICED gap rides as per-group `unpriced_calls`/`unpriced_tokens` columns on `report` and as an `unpriced` row on compare/study. `cage human`/`cage trend` keep attested vs derived as separate `kind` rows — never blended, same as the text sections.
- **Raw-row CSV** — `cage export --csv calls|receipts|tasks [--since …]`: flattened ledger rows for pivot tables, the ledger's own PII surface (counts and ids, never content); honors import-before-export; closed per-kind column contracts (`exportcmd.RAW_CSV_FIELDS` — the schema tuples + the additive fleet `machine` stamp; tasks pin identity/outcome/label/estimate/git-snapshot fields). `--format csv` is now the legacy spelling of `--csv calls` and inherits the LF/canonical-cell fixes (it previously emitted CRLF). Bad combinations are typed `CageError`s: `--csv`+`--json`/`--html`/`--format`, `--study`+`--csv`, `--agent`/`--project` on non-call kinds, `--csv` on non-report study actions.
- **Skill: reporting recipes on all four hosts** — the rendered `cage` assets (claude/codex SKILL.md · copilot prompt · kiro steering · generic agents skill) teach "generate my cost report / CSV / summary": weekly spend (`cage report --csv --since 7d`), per-tool savings (`cage attrib --csv`), worth-it (`cage verdict <tool>`, quoted verbatim), fleet number (`cage study report --csv`), estimate accuracy (`cage calibration --csv`) — plus the summarization rules: quote cage's numbers verbatim, keep method tags and UNPRICED/observational caveats, never fill a refusal (INSUFFICIENT DATA stays in the summary), default save path `./cage-report-<view>-<since>.csv`. Edited via `tools/skillgen/fragments/` only; rendered + blessed; `--check` clean.
- **MCP parity** — `format: "csv"` on `cage_report`/`cage_attrib`/`cage_roi` returns the same `render_csv` output, so extension-hosted agents without shell access can still produce the CSV content.
- **`cage query csv-output`** — new concept entry: which views, the column law, same-numbers guarantee, bundle-vs-CSV distinction; the export help text documents the distinction too.
- Validation: golden byte-exact CSVs over the seeded §4.4 demo ledger, determinism double-runs, text-vs-CSV same-numbers assertions, method-tag column on every view, PII grep on raw CSVs, RFC-4180 round-trip (and the label/phase single-token guard that keeps commas out of grouping keys), MCP parity vs the goldens; dummyrepo **S8** adds `report --csv`/`attrib --csv` to the byte-identical + CAGE_DEBUG-no-drift sweep. +34 tests (509→543).

## v0.20.0 (2026-07-11) — portable wiring (no absolute paths in committed files)

Fixes a sharing bug: wired hook/MCP entries embedded the wiring machine's **absolute cage path**, and several wired files are committed to git (`.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook`) — so one developer's filesystem layout shipped to the whole team and every clone got broken wiring. Setup-time path resolution is replaced by a **committed runtime-resolving shim**. Design of record: `docs/portable-wiring.md`.

- **The shim (`cage/runshim.py`)** — `cage setup` writes `.cage/bin/cage-run` (plain POSIX sh, no bash-isms) + the Windows twin `cage-run.cmd`: identical bytes on every machine, intended to be committed (`.cage/.gitignore` excludes only `ledger/`/`out/`/`state/`). At runtime it resolves cage in documented order: `command -v cage` → `~/.local/bin/cage` / pipx / an active `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/cage` → `python3 -m cage` if importable → **exit 0 silently**. A clone without cage installed = working agents, no noise, no capture — fail-open extended to wiring (doctor diagnoses; the hook path never complains). All args pass through. The `.cmd` twin mirrors the order (`where cage` → `%USERPROFILE%` installs → `Scripts\` venv → `py -m cage`), labelled UNVERIFIED on a real Windows agent host. Execute bit set at write time, fail-open for `core.fileMode=false` clones (doctor runs the shim via `sh`, so the answer never depends on the bit).
- **Committed wiring references the shim, never a binary path** — per-host mechanism verified against each host's docs and recorded in each wire module's docstring: Claude hooks use the documented `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` placeholder (hook cwd is NOT guaranteed to be the project root); `.mcp.json` uses documented `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}` env expansion (the `:-.` default is a documented requirement); `.vscode/mcp.json` uses documented `${workspaceFolder}` substitution; Codex + Kiro hooks get a **self-locating one-liner** (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` → exec the shim → `exit 0` if either is missing) because Codex documents hook cwd as the *session* cwd (its docs themselves recommend git-root resolution) and Kiro documents neither cwd nor variables.
- **The ONE exception, documented not silent** — `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` stays machine-absolute by necessity: Kiro spawns MCP servers from its *install directory* (kirodotdev/Kiro #6525) and supports no variable substitution in `command` (open FR #5659), so a relative/variable form provably breaks. Doctor advises gitignoring it. **User-level configs unchanged**: `~/.copilot/hooks/cage.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml` MCP, and `.git/hooks/*` are per-machine by nature — the resolved absolute path stays the robust choice there (the "bare `cage` fails under a GUI PATH" constraint still holds; the shim now carries that resolution for committed files).
- **Migration** — re-running `cage setup --wire-only --<agent>` detects legacy absolute/bare entries in committed files, rewrites them to the shim form (foreign hooks never touched; custom flags on a cage command survive), and prints what it migrated. Setup twice ⇒ byte-identical, still. Legacy absolute entries keep working until the user re-runs setup — the shim path is additive.
- **Doctor `portability` check** — flags any committed wired file carrying a machine-absolute cage path (teammates' clones break — re-run setup), a missing or execute-bit-less shim, and runs `cage-run --version` to verify resolution succeeds on this machine; prints the kiro-MCP gitignore advice.
- **`cage query portable-wiring`** — new concept entry: why the shim exists, the resolution order, fail-open-when-absent, committed vs user-level, the one-exception host.
- Validation: dummyrepo **S1** now clone-simulates (copies the wired testbed sans `.git`/gitignored dirs to a new path → doctor portability clean there → the committed shim actually resolves and passes args through). New `tests/test_portable_wiring.py` pins the never-rot invariant (grep every committed wired file for absolute paths), the shim resolution order incl. absent-cage → silent exit 0, cleanup-allowlist unreachability of `.cage/bin/`, migration exactly-once, and the doctor flags. +13 tests (496→509).

## v0.19.0 (2026-07-11) — pricing management (the unpriced workflow, `cage prices`, policy versioning)

A ledger is only as honest as its price table. This release makes the price table a managed surface: find what's billing $0, fix it with one pasted line, know when the bundled rates have moved on — plus two riders (self-refreshing exports, state-dir cleanup) that keep fleet bundles complete and footprints tidy. Driven by a real field report: copilot-served Claude models (`copilot/claude-opus-4.6`, dotted ids, `provider="anthropic"`) and the router pseudo-model `copilot/auto` (empty provider) silently billing $0.

- **`cage prices` command group (plan §3.3)** — `unpriced` scans the resolved ledger for `none`-match calls and prints call count, token volume, and a ready-to-run fix line per key; `set <provider> <model> --input --output [--cache-read]` is an idempotent insert-or-update of a project row (validated: non-negative, `cache_read ≤ input`; `--cache-read` defaults to 0.1× input, announced); `alias - copilot/auto --to anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` routes a router pseudo-model explicitly (`-` = the empty provider such rows stamp; target must be an exact row — never a guess, and a dangling alias surfaces UNPRICED); `list` shows every visible row with bundled-vs-project origin and which wins; `sync` diffs the project against the installed bundle (dry-run; `--update --yes <prov>/<model>` applies per confirmed row). Typed `CageError`s at the boundary; `--json` uses the `cage.v1` envelope.
- **The write layer (`cage/pricestoml.py`)** — the bundled policy is read-only at runtime; all writes land in the project policy.toml as text surgery, never a whole-file rewrite: in-place value edits for hand-written tables (comments survive, header marked `# cage:custom`) or a deterministic cage-managed block (sorted; two inserts in either order ⇒ identical bytes). Every mutation re-parses before an atomic `os.replace` — a bad write can never leave an unparseable policy behind.
- **Bundled prices refreshed (researched 2026-07-11, source URLs cited in the file)** — Anthropic: Opus 4.7/4.6/4.5 rows added (the explicit 4-5 row is load-bearing against a tie-break onto retired `claude-opus-4` at 15/75), deprecated Opus 4.1/4 kept so historical rows reprice at what they actually billed, Sonnet 5 (standard rate; the intro-window override documented in place), Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 3.5. OpenAI: the gpt-5.6 trio and 5.5-pro/5.4-mini/5.4-nano/5.4-pro added; **two cache-read fixes** (gpt-5.5 1.25→0.50, gpt-5.4 0.625→0.25 per the official page). `copilot/auto` ships UNPRICED with a commented-out alias example — a router priced silently is a wrong number.
- **Effort-tier + punctuation + route-prefix normalization** — family matching now canonicalizes before segment comparison: known router prefixes strip (`copilot/` — a closed list, unknown routers stay UNPRICED), `.` folds to `-` (`claude-sonnet-4.6` family-matches the `claude-sonnet-4-6` row), and trailing effort tiers (`low|medium|high|max`) drop — both vendors bill every tier at the same per-token rate (verified 2026-07-11), so tiers price at the base row with the family footnote, never `exact` (method law). Behavior change: a dotted minor with no exact row (`gpt-5.7`) now family-prices at its base row instead of UNPRICED — footnoted, and current minors ship exact rows.
- **Merge-granularity fix** — `policy.load` now merges `prices`/`credits`/`alias` per provider *and* per model: a partial project `[prices.anthropic."x"]` table no longer silently wipes the bundled anthropic siblings.
- **Policy versioning (`[meta]`)** — the bundle stamps `prices_version`/`prices_date`/`cage_version`; `cage init` copies (and a first `prices set` stamps) it into the project policy. `cage doctor` and `prices list` print one recommendation line when the bundle is newer — never auto-applied; `sync --update` preserves customized rows by construction and requires per-row confirmation for unmarked drift (cage can't reconstruct which old bundle a row came from — honest over clever).
- **UNPRICED is now loud on every publishing surface** — `report`, the bare-`cage` overview, `compare`, and `study report` print `⚠ N calls (X tokens) UNPRICED — totals understated; run 'cage prices unpriced'` whenever `none`-match calls exist, so a fleet analyst can't publish a total without seeing the gap. Repricing is derive-time (the ledger stores counts, not conclusions): fixing policy.toml re-prices every imported bundle row retroactively; self-costed rows and receipts keep their stored figures. Report also gains a `≈ priced by alias` footnote.
- **Rider: export imports everything first (plan §3.7)** — `cage export` (plain and `--study`) runs the full all-agent sweep before emitting (`--agent` now filters output only, never the capture), so a capture-only machine ships a complete bundle from one command. `--no-import` keeps the as-is snapshot; new `[capture] import_before_export` policy toggle (precedence: flag > `CAGE_CAPTURE` env > policy); the sweep is fail-open (a broken parser warns and export proceeds); the study manifest records `refresh: {ran, new_calls}` (counts only) and the analyst's import surfaces it (`swept +N at export`).
- **Rider: state-dir cleanup (`cage/cleanup.py`, plan §3.6.4)** — a closed allowlist over `.cage/state/`: aged `debug.log`/`hooks-seen.jsonl` rows, stale `pending-*` provenance buffers, cursors whose source log is gone, `*.tmp`. Never — by construction: `ledger/`, policy.toml, the machine id, `study.jsonl`, `limits.json`. `[cleanup] enabled/days` (default on/30; env `CAGE_CLEANUP` overrides); the auto path piggybacks on `cage import`/hook sweeps (throttled, fail-open, debug-logged under `cleanup.prune`); manual `cage cleanup` is dry-run until `--apply`. State files are never read by derived views — cleanup can't change a reported number (tested byte-identical).
- **`cage query` coverage** — nine new entries, all live-interpolated: calculations `pricing-match`, `unpriced`, `repricing`; concepts `prices-cli`, `effort-tiers`, `policy-versioning`, `copilot-pricing` (copilot-served Claude at Anthropic list rates ≈ GitHub's own AI-Credits metering basis since 2026-06-01; `[credits]` stays a separate layer), `cleanup`, `import-before-export`. The UNPRICED report line points at `cage query unpriced`. `cage doctor` gains `prices-meta` and `state` checks.
- **Validation** — dummyrepo scenario **S11** (seeded unpriced calls → exact `prices unpriced` output → `set`+`alias` → report re-prices to exact expected USD with the ledger untouched → stale `[meta]` → sync recommendation → restamp clears it) and an 8th fleet machine in **S9** that never runs `cage import` — its bundle is complete purely via export's sweep and the analyst's totals stay exact. +55 tests (441→496).

## v0.18.0 (2026-07-11) — derived human attention (passive minutes from turn gaps)

Total cost's missing half: what the agent costs in **human time**, derived passively from the session logs cage already imports — with the manual axis as the ground truth that calibrates the heuristic (plan §4.10; `docs/human-baseline.design.md` §5c).

- **`gap_ms` on the call row (additive, optional)** — at import, where a transcript carries per-turn timestamps, each call row gains the wall-clock gap between the previous assistant turn's end and the human turn that led to this call. Per-agent availability is documented, never guessed: **claude yes** (every record timestamped; tool-result / meta / sidechain records correctly never count as human turns); **codex / copilot / kiro no** — their pinned log formats lack a usable timestamp pair, so their rows omit the field (**no signal ⇒ no field, never fabricated**). Composite ids unchanged (`gap_ms` never enters an id); an unstamped row is byte-identical to the legacy contract; re-imports stay idempotent.
- **Read-time derivation, one module** (`cage/attention.py`) — derived attention minutes = `Σ min(gap_ms, idle cap)`; every consuming view calls in here, none computes gaps itself. The idle cap guards against billing walked-away time as supervision: policy `[human] idle_cap_minutes` wins, `constants.IDLE_CAP_MINUTES` (10, rationale in the file) is the fallback — changing it re-derives, the ledger is never rewritten. Deterministic: same ledger + policy ⇒ same minutes.
- **Method honesty** — derived minutes are always `estimated`, labelled `derived (turn-gaps, capped)`. **Attested** minutes (`cage human-record`, or the new friction-drop `cage outcome <task> --minutes N` — the same fail-open, idempotent receipt path) rank above derived: per task **attested wins, derived renders as reference, the two are never summed**.
- **Views** — `cage human` and `cage trend` show attested vs derived as separate blocks (absence of gap data is an explicit line). `cage compare`, `cage verdict`, and `cage study report` gain one **total-cost line** — agent $ + human minutes × rate, tagged with the human component's method — suppressed by `--agent-only`. `matrix --human` is byte-identical (a different question).
- **`cage calibration --human`** — over tasks with BOTH attested and derived minutes, the derived/attested ratio distribution (median + IQR) is the heuristic's **measured** accuracy; below `MIN_ESTIMATE_N` it refuses. The heuristic never self-reports confidence.
- **Explainers** — new `cage query` calculation entry `attention-minutes` ("how are human minutes derived", live cap value) and an extended `human-axis` concept entry.
- **The watcher guard** — deliberately NOT built: no editor plugins, activity trackers, keystroke or focus monitoring. Transcript timestamps only; PII surface unchanged (timestamp arithmetic, counts-never-content).
- Validation: dummyrepo scenario **S10** (seeded transcript gap → exact derived minutes across human/compare/verdict; attest → precedence + exact calibration ratio; `--agent-only` clean; byte-identical re-runs). +23 tests (418→441).

## v0.17.1 (2026-07-09) — dead-code cleanup

A systematic AST sweep (unused imports, unreferenced functions/methods/constants, tracked junk, wheel-content audit) after the parity release:

- Removed `humanview`'s unused `quality` import (leftover from when the redo-guard moved to `tasks.read`) and the unreferenced `Footprint.out_file()` helper (`serve` uses the `out` property directly, which stays).
- `schema.PROVENANCE_FIELDS` was unreferenced but is the documented substrate contract (plan §3.5) — instead of deleting a contract constant, a new shape test pins `make_provenance` rows to exactly those keys in that order (additive-only schema, enforced). +1 test (417→418).
- Everything else suspected came back wired and in use (`serve`/`adoptcmd`/`metercmd`/`usageparse`/`wizard`/`cfgio`/`pointers`, the legacy `import-claude`/`import-codex` subcommands, `data/shims/`); no tracked junk, no orphaned fixtures. The brand images stay bundled (`data/assets/*` in package-data) by choice.

## v0.17.0 (2026-07-08) — Windows/mac parity + the path probe

- **Three-OS CI gate** — the workflow matrix is now `ubuntu/macos/windows-latest` × Python 3.11–3.13, running the suite, the skillgen drift check, **and** the S1–S9 scenario runner (`PYTHONUTF8=1`; the runner pins subprocess decoding to UTF-8 so cp1252 consoles can't corrupt output). macOS stays field-validated; **Windows is CI-tested** — the honest wording until someone runs `docs/windows-manual-checklist.md` (new) on a real Windows machine.
- **Per-OS log locations, one registry** — `paths.agent_log_sources(agent)` is the single table of candidate `(location, glob)` pairs `cage import` scans and the probe reports. `vscode_user_candidates()` gains `%APPDATA%\Code\User` (documented VS Code location); `kiro_data_candidates()` gains `%APPDATA%\Kiro\User\globalStorage\kiro.kiroagent` — labeled **UNVERIFIED-LAYOUT** (inferred from VS Code-family, not pinned on a real Windows Kiro; the probe report carries the same label). Env overrides win everywhere, unchanged. A missing source dir no longer scans as a phantom `[src]` candidate.
- **One fail-open lock helper** (`cage/lockutil.py`) — `fcntl.flock` → `msvcrt.locking` → proceed-unlocked, replacing the two copied blocks in `importcmd`/`originrecord`; the no-primitive tier is debug-logged, id-dedupe stays the correctness backstop.
- **Windows-shaped wiring** — hook commands quote the resolved cage path (`"C:\…\Scripts\cage.exe" import …` would otherwise split at the space); `reresolve_cage_command` heals `cage.exe`/backslash/quoted forms; Codex's TOML MCP block writes forward slashes (backslashes are TOML escapes); git hooks keep the POSIX-minimal `#!/bin/sh` wrappers — Git-for-Windows always runs hooks under its bundled sh, making that the provably portable choice.
- **Console safety** — `cli.main` degrades the ✔/·/⚠ glyphs on non-UTF consoles (`errors="replace"`) instead of dying with UnicodeEncodeError on cp1252; the scheduler hint is OS-aware (cron line on POSIX, a `schtasks /create` example on Windows — printed, never installed).
- **`cage doctor --paths` + probe events (the exportable path diagnostic)** — `cage/pathprobe.py` renders one read-only screen per agent × candidate location: found/missing, files matched, parseable row count, cursor state, one why-line per miss ("location absent", "no files match <glob>", "cursor: already imported", "parse: 0 rows — see debug.log"), env overrides and UNVERIFIED-LAYOUT candidates labeled, ending with the active sink + precedence chain. It writes nothing. The same facts stream to `debug.log` as metadata-only `probe` events during `CAGE_DEBUG=1 cage import`, and `cage doctor --bundle` now ships the report as `paths.txt` (home-prefix redaction applies). New explain entry: `cage query "why is nothing being captured"`. +16 tests (401→417).

## v0.16.0 (2026-07-08) — cost-impact roadmap: validate · diagnose

Accumulating release for the cost-impact roadmap phases (`docs/archive/v0.16-cost-impact-roadmap.handoff.md`); each phase lands as a subsection below. Suite 318→401 across P0–P5 + the manual validation (roadmap complete).

### Manual validation (full-test-plan, 2026-07) — real-extension capture bugs

Findings from executing `docs/full-test-plan-sibling-repo.md` (run record: `docs/archive/v0.16-full-test-run.md`) against real Claude Code / Codex / Copilot VS Code extensions and the Kiro IDE (`../cage-testbed`):

- **Codex call ids no longer collide across sessions** (`transcript.parse_codex_calls`) — the id carried `session[:8]`, but every rollout stem starts with `rollout-`, so all Codex sessions shared one id namespace and `hooks.append_new` silently dropped colliding line indexes: on the validation machine **150 of 368 real calls (41%, ≈$11) were lost as false "dupes"**. The session component is now `sha1(session)[:8]` — deterministic per (session, line), unique across sessions. Existing ledger rows keep their old ids (append-only); unchanged rollouts are cursor-skipped, so historical undercount persists unless the ledger is rebuilt.
- **Codex rows carry the event's own timestamp** — `parse_codex_calls` stamped rows at import time, filing a May rollout in the import month's shard and breaking `--since`/month partitioning. The row `ts` is now the `token_count` event's `timestamp` (fallback to write-time when absent). Codex fixtures drop `ts` from `volatile`.
- **Derive-time repricing everywhere** — `regression`, `forecast`, `quality`, `trend`, `cage human` (humanview), and `cage why` summed the *stored* `est_cost_usd`, which is 0.0 for every transcript-sourced call — a $3,800 ledger read as "$0 drift / no spend / agent-side free". All six now route through `prices.call_usd` (tokens × policy at derive time), exactly like `report`/`budget`.
- **Provenance writes are race-safe and file-deduped** (`originrecord.record`) — two hook processes firing at once (SessionEnd delivered to two VS Code windows) could both pass the `_already_recorded` check before either appended (observed: duplicate rows 0.6 ms apart); an exclusive `state/provenance.lock` (same fail-open pattern as `importcmd._import_lock`) closes the window, and repeated files within one row (`["a.py","a.py"]` from two Write events) are kept once.
- **Fixtures: two of three `UNVERIFIED-FORMAT` cells closed with real sanitized captures** — `codex/vscode` (the `openai.chatgpt` extension writes the *same* `~/.codex/sessions` rollout store/format as the CLI) and `kiro/vscode` (this machine's real `tokens_generated.jsonl`, counts-only by construction). `copilot/vscode` stays a stand-in: the extension's real log was located (`…/workspaceStorage/<hash>/GitHub.copilot-chat/transcripts/<session>.jsonl`, same event stream as the CLI) but carries no usage-bearing `session.shutdown` event in a live session, and cage's default scan doesn't cover that location yet.
- **The real `~/.cage` is never a project root, even under a `CAGE_HOME` redirect** (`paths.find_project_root`) — the prep fix excluded only `global_base()`, which *moves* with `CAGE_HOME`, so a redirected run (tests, `tools.dummyrepo`) saw the real `~/.cage` as a project and resolved every dir under `$HOME` to the home — the scenario runner wrote its sandbox fixture/fleet rows into the user's **real global ledger**. Both the active global sink and the default `~/.cage` are now excluded; the runner leaves the real global byte-untouched (verified by checksum).
- **`render.ago` floors at "just now", never per-second** — "0s ago" → "2s ago" made back-to-back runs of the same view byte-different, which is exactly what the determinism sweeps (plan Part G, runner S8) compare.
- Carried from the prep session: `paths.find_project_root` no longer treats the global `~/.cage` sink as a project root; a malformed `--since` is a typed `CageError` (was silently ignored).
- **Copilot VS Code extension capture works** (`transcript.parse_copilot_vscode_calls` + a second scan root in `importcmd.import_copilot`) — the extension's `GitHub.copilot-chat/transcripts/` event stream never carries a usage event (no `session.shutdown`, even after quitting VS Code; pinned v0.54.0/1.126), so the per-request token counts are read from **VS Code's chat-session store** (`<vscode-user>/workspaceStorage/*/chatSessions/*.jsonl`, `CAGE_VSCODE_USER` override): requests merge last-write-wins by `requestId` (the store rewrites its array as the session grows), ids derive from the requestId (idempotent re-import), non-copilot chat providers are filtered, and only counts/ids/model/ts are ever read — titles and message bodies never. The third `UNVERIFIED-FORMAT` fixture cell is closed with a real sanitized session; all 8 agent×surface cells are now `format_verified`. The virtual `copilot/auto` model stays unpriced (doctor flags it) — a wrong number is worse than none.
- **A hook firing outside any project captures into the global ledger** — `hooks._root`, `hooks.post_commit`, `hooks.prepare_commit_msg`, `metering._resolve_root`, and `mcpserver._root` all fell back to the *cwd* when no project `.cage/` existed, growing a stray `.cage/` in whatever dir the session ran from and splitting the ledger (observed live in the resolver-precedence check). All five now use `paths.resolve_root` (override → project → global, plan §3.7).
- **`cage watch` exits 130 on Ctrl-C** per the CLI exit-code contract (was a deliberate 0; ruled against).
- **`cage doctor --bundle` redacts the home prefix** — `$HOME` → `~` in every member, including Claude's slug-escaped project dir names (`-Users-me-…`): machine-local paths stay diagnostic, the account username no longer ships in a bundle meant to be shared.
- +12 tests across the validation passes (389→401).

### P5 — `cage study`: the fleet study (N laptops, two phases, one analyst)

- **Opaque machine id** (`cage/machine.py`) — a random id generated once into `.cage/state/machine.json` (never hostname/username/anything derivable — the analyst keeps the name↔id mapping offline), stamped as an additive optional `machine` field on calls/receipts/tasks at the one write chokepoint (`ledger.append_row`). **Opt-in by existence**: only an enrolled ledger stamps; unenrolled ledgers stay byte-identical to the legacy contract (every pre-P5 exact-byte test passes unchanged). Plan §3.4 updated.
- **Recorded phases, not remembered dates** (`cage/study.py`) — `cage study start <phase>` / `stop` append marker rows (phase = one validated token, the `label` PII guard) to a fifth small append-only file, `ledger/study.jsonl`. Derive assigns each row by its own `ts` against **that machine's own markers** — deterministic, no derive clocks, and cross-machine clock skew cannot cross-assign (tested). Last marker wins forward in time; a `start` without `stop` extends; rows before any marker are *unphased* — excluded from deltas, visibly counted.
- **One-file collection** — `cage export --study` writes one zip per machine (raw rows + markers + a **counts-only manifest**: version, machine id, span, row counts per kind); `cage import bundle1 bundle2 …` merges into a fresh analysis ledger by row identity — calls/receipts by id, tasks/markers by whole-row content so task *updates* (the close!) survive the merge — idempotent on re-import (tested byte-for-byte). The refs/notes team path stays for git-fluent teams; bundles are the capture-only fleet path.
- **Coverage before conclusions** — `cage study report` opens with per-machine days-with-rows per phase and **flags gap days** (the silent-mid-week laptop is the #1 study-killer), then the number: the sample unit is the **machine-day** (a capture-only fleet closes no tasks; the study's question is what a week costs), per-machine-day totals **measured**, and the **paired-by-machine delta** — median over machines of (phase-B median daily − phase-A median daily), controlling between-machine variance — tagged **`estimated`** with the different-work-mix caveat. Below `MIN_COMPARE_N` machines with both phases the delta refuses; coverage always renders.
- **One-command enrollment** — `cage study join <phase>`: scaffold → wire all four agents → start the phase → `cage doctor` + the cron hint (cage installs no scheduler). Plus `cage study id` to read the opaque id.
- **Explainability + validation** — new `study-pairing` explain entry (`cage query "how does the fleet study pair machines"`); flagship skill regenerated; `--json` uses the `cage.v1` envelope. Runner scenario **S9**: 7 simulated machines (5 complete, 1 mid-week gap, 1 missing phase 2 — the handoff's 3-machine sketch predates the min-n gate, the S5 precedent) → real-CLI bundles → import-merge → exact coverage, gap flagged, pairs 6, exact −7,000 tok/day paired delta, double-import idempotent. +13 tests (376→389).

### P4 — `cage verdict <tool>`: the one-line answer, composed not computed

- **`cage verdict <tool> [--since]`** (`cage/verdict.py`) — `VERDICT: graphify is SAVING ≈ $X/mo net (modeled)` / `COSTING` / `INSUFFICIENT DATA`, as a **pure composer**: net = roi saved − roi own-cost (its sign *is* the verdict); marginal saving from attribution's latest task-linked receipt; direction from trend (the ledger-wide human axis, labelled as such); drift from regression; redo-rate from quality; break-even = net per receipt. It computes **no new statistics** — the ≈$/mo line is plain arithmetic scaling net by the receipts' own time-span (row timestamps, no clock) and refuses below a 7-day span rather than project from noise.
- **Every input renders its own method tag** — modeled attribution/roi (roi's tag is the least-trusted method among the tool's receipts, attribution's worst-case rule), estimated trend, measured drift and redo-rate — and any unavailable input prints `INSUFFICIENT DATA — <reason>` on its line, never an approximation. A tool with no receipts gets the honest headline refusal (and no numbers alongside it).
- **Explainability + surfaces** — `cage query "how is the verdict calculated"` (new `verdict-composition` entry); flagship skill regenerated with the "is tool X worth keeping" pointer; `--json` uses the `cage.v1` envelope. Runner scenario **S7** seeds a clearly net-positive tool and a clearly net-negative one (own cost $0.50/receipt vs $0.005 saved) and asserts SAVING, COSTING, the insufficient-data path, rendered tags, and byte-identical re-runs — completing the S1–S8 matrix. +6 tests (370→376), including a composer-honesty test pinning verdict's numbers to roi's exactly.

### P3 — `cage estimate` + `cage calibration`: estimate before, measure the gap after

- **`cage estimate [--scope] [--label] [--agent]`** (`cage/estimate.py`, on the shared `taskgroup` core) — a pre-task cost band: **median + IQR of measured totals over closed tasks matching the exact keys** (no similarity scoring, no ML — cage law), tagged **`modeled`** because history applied to an unrun task is a reconstruction, never an invoice. Below the new `constants.MIN_ESTIMATE_N = 5` it refuses with the reason — a band over noise is worse than no band. Deterministic; distinct from `forecast` (monthly projection, untouched).
- **`--record <task>`** stamps the estimate onto the **open** task row as additive fields — the spec'd `est_tokens` / `est_usd` / `est_n` plus the token band bounds `est_tokens_q1` / `est_tokens_q3` (decided at review: calibration must score against the band *as it was at estimate time*; recomputing over grown history would score a different band). Fail-open write; recording onto an already-closed task is refused at the CLI boundary (a retroactive estimate is exactly what calibration must never count). Plan §3.4 updated; empty = legacy contract.
- **`cage calibration`** (`cage/calibration.py`) — the estimator's empirical confidence: over closed tasks with recorded estimates, the actual/estimate **ratio distribution** (median + IQR) and the **in-band hit-rate**, both tagged **`measured`** (an observed frequency of recorded numbers). Open, zero-actual, and band-less (legacy) estimates are skipped with a visible count, never silently dropped. Ends with the plain-English line — "estimates landed in-band N% of the time (n=…)" — the estimator itself never self-reports confidence.
- **Explainability + surfaces** — `cage query "how is the estimate calculated"` answers from live values (`MIN_ESTIMATE_N` interpolated; new `estimate-band` + `calibration-hit-rate` registry entries); flagship skill regenerated (all four agents); `--json` on both commands uses the `cage.v1` envelope. Runner scenario **S6** drives the full loop through the real CLI — estimate (exact band) → refusal on thin history → `--record` ×2 → tasks run → `cage outcome` → calibration exact 50% hit-rate, byte-identical re-run. +10 tests (360→370).

### P2 — `cage compare`: measured stack comparison (observed groups, honest delta)

- **`cage compare`** (`cage/compare.py` + the shared `cage/taskgroup.py` P3 will reuse) — groups **closed** tasks by their *observed* stack signature (sorted joined-receipt tools; `human` excluded — the Tier-1 anchor is not a pipeline tool; empty ⇒ `agent-only`) and prints per group `n · median · IQR` of **measured** totals: recorded `tokens_in+tokens_out`, USD recomputed per call via `prices.call_usd`. Join precedence documented in the module: task-id first, then a session-window fallback (a task-less row joins when its session matches and its `ts` falls inside the task's call span — overlaps resolve to the smallest task id, a stable order). Median/IQR via stdlib inclusive quartiles; cross-month tasks read through the shard glob.
- **The delta is `estimated`, never `measured`** — median(stack) − median(agent-only baseline sharing every non-stack key), rendered with its method tag and the always-printed caveat: *observed difference across different tasks — not a controlled experiment*. No causal language anywhere.
- **Min-n gate, blocking** — new `constants.MIN_COMPARE_N = 5` (rationale comment in the third numbers-layer): a smaller group renders `insufficient data (n=X < 5)` and joins no delta. The command explains; it never numbers.
- **Additive task `label`** — `cage outcome <task> --label <word>` tags a task with one short token (letters/digits/`._-`, ≤32 chars, validated at the CLI boundary — never a path or free text; the `scope` PII spirit). `cage compare --by label` / `--label` group and filter on it; empty = legacy contract, plan §3.4 updated.
- **Explainability + surfaces** — `cage query "how does compare work"` answers from live values (`MIN_COMPARE_N` interpolated, new `compare-delta` registry entry); the flagship skill (all four agent renderings, via skillgen) points agents at `cage compare` for "did the tool actually cost less"; `--json` uses the `cage.v1` envelope. Runner scenario **S5** seeds 5 agent-only + 5 graphify (one cross-month pair) + a 2-task group and asserts exact medians, the estimated delta + caveat, the refusal, and byte-identical re-runs (the handoff's 3+3 sketch predates min-n = 5). +12 tests (348→360).

### P1 — diagnostics: `cage doctor --bundle` + "fail-open but never silent", audited

- **`cage doctor --bundle [path]`** (`cage/doctorbundle.py`) — one redacted diagnostics archive for capture bug-reports, under the ledger's own PII rule (**counts-never-content**): doctor output (text + json), the metadata-only `debug.log` + `hooks-seen.jsonl` (when present), cage/python/platform versions, resolved footprint paths with per-shard **row counts** (never a row body), policy **provenance** (bundled default vs project file, which cage env overrides are set), and the import cursor state. Per-member fail-open — an unreadable member lands in the manifest's `skipped` map with its reason, never aborting the bundle — while an unwritable *target* raises the one `CageError` (the read/CLI boundary). Archive bytes are deterministic (fixed zip epoch + member order).
- **Every capture-path swallow-site now leaves an attributable `debug.log` line under `CAGE_DEBUG=1`** — previously-silent sites got ADD-only trace lines (no control-flow change, all guarded so tracing can never break capture): a failed `ledger.append_row` (the unwritable-ledger case — the one failure that loses a row) records `ledger.append/write-failed` with the shard + row id; `hooks.prepare_commit_msg`'s bare swallow and a failed pending-edit buffer write now log; `importcmd`'s lock-unavailable, corrupt-cursor-load, and cursor-save failures log; and a **non-empty log parsing to 0 rows** — the upstream format-drift signature — records `skip=parsed-zero-rows` with the file + byte count.
- **Coverage audit test** (`tests/test_debug_coverage.py`) — 14 tests, one per swallow-site, each forcing exactly that failure and asserting fail-open holds (exit 0 / `False`, never a raise) *and* the named debug event appears: "fail-open but never silent" is now tested, not aspirational.
- **Runner scenarios S3 + S4** — `python -m tools.dummyrepo` now exercises the broken setups end-to-end (malformed policy degrades + logs + doctor flags it; unwritable ledger fails open + logs; truncated shard tail still reads; empty log imports 0) and produces + PII-greps a real bundle. +20 tests (328→348).

### P0 — capture validation harness

Before comparing or estimating anything, prove capture actually works on every agent × surface combination. No behavior change to cage itself — this phase adds the harness that pins existing behavior. +10 tests (318→328).

- **Fixture corpus** — `tests/fixtures/transcripts/<agent>/<surface>/` for all four agents (claude / codex / copilot / kiro) × (cli / vscode): sanitized session-log samples in each agent's real on-disk shape (realistic token counts, all content stripped), each with an `expected.json` freezing the exact call rows `cage import` must produce — deterministic ids included, `ts` excluded only for codex/kiro whose logs carry no per-row timestamp (the parser stamps write time). `tests/test_fixture_corpus.py` parametrizes over the corpus, plants each log into an isolated fake agent home at its real relative location, runs the real default (pathless) import scan, and asserts exact rows + idempotent re-import. A structural test fails if any agent × surface directory ever goes missing (the four-agent invariant, enforced).
- **`UNVERIFIED-FORMAT` stand-ins, never invented formats** — the codex/copilot/kiro VS Code-extension fixtures are CLI-format stand-ins until real extension logs are captured (handoff §10 open question); they are flagged `format_verified: false` in `expected.json` and marked `UNVERIFIED-FORMAT` in the corpus README, and a test asserts the flagging discipline (only vscode fixtures may be stand-ins; every CLI format is pinned against a real client log).
- **Dummy sibling-repo scenario runner** — `python -m tools.dummyrepo` (build-time only, stdlib-only, never in the wheel — the `tools/skillgen` rules): scaffolds a disposable repo beside the checkout, sandboxes every agent home + `CAGE_HOME` via env overrides (nothing touches real machine data), and runs the automatable scenario matrix from `docs/archive/v0.16-dummy-repo-test.plan.md` §9: **S1** (all four agents wire, planted CLI logs import to exact rows, doctor exits 0), **S2** (extension-format logs import with hooks unwired, re-import byte-identical via the cursor), **S8** (six derived views byte-identical across runs, and `CAGE_DEBUG=1` changes no derived output), plus a counts-never-content PII grep of everything the ledger wrote. S3–S7 render `PENDING` with the phase that ships them (P1–P4); live-agent steps print as an explicit `MANUAL` checklist, never silently skipped. Exits 1 on any failure and keeps the sandbox for inspection; cleans up on success.

## v0.15.2 — Fable 5 / Mythos 5 pricing + two doc/interpolation papercuts

A second validation-pass batch, found by re-testing v0.15.1 against a real cross-project ledger. Additive; fail-open preserved; +1 regression test (suite 317→318).

- **`claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5` now priced.** Real Fable 5 usage was costing out at **$0** with an `⚠ UNPRICED` warning: `claude-fable-5` shares only the `claude` segment with the opus/sonnet/haiku rows (< 2 segments), so `policy.price_match`'s family fallback can't reach it — it needs its own exact row. Added `[prices.anthropic."claude-fable-5"]` and `[prices.anthropic."claude-mythos-5"]` at **$10 / $50 per MTok, $1 cache-read** (Anthropic's published Fable/Mythos tier). A regression test pins that the bundled policy prices both exactly.

- **`cage query overview` / `data-flow` show the real on-disk paths.** The concept text interpolated the legacy unpartitioned `calls.jsonl` / `receipts.jsonl`, but the ledger is month-partitioned — that single file doesn't exist on a fresh ledger. It now shows the shard glob `calls-*.jsonl` / `receipts-*.jsonl`, matching what's actually on disk.

- **Test-plan doc drift corrected.** `docs/archive/v0.16-dummy-repo-test.plan.md` §5 listed `cage report --html PATH` (no such flag — the HTML surface is `cage serve`) and `cage export --json` as a stand-in for the summary; both lines now match the real CLI (`cage export --json` is a first-class alias as of v0.15.1).

## v0.15.1 — validation-pass fixes (concurrent-import dedup + three CLI/setup papercuts)

Fixes surfaced by an end-to-end validation pass on a disposable repo. All additive: no `CALL_FIELDS`/`make_call` change, no ledger rewrite, fail-open contract preserved. +6 regression tests (`tests/test_validation_fixes.py`), one per finding.

- **Concurrent-import double-count closed (the one real correctness bug).** Two capture sweeps racing on the same ledger — a Stop hook and a SessionStart sweep firing at once — could *both* snapshot the `seen` id-set before either appended, landing one turn twice (observed: an identical `call_id` written twice, doubling that call in `cage report`). `importcmd.run` now holds an exclusive `flock` on `.cage/state/import.lock` across the read-check-append section, so the second sweep rebuilds `seen` only after the first commits and `hooks.append_new`'s id-dedupe catches it. **Fail-open**: no `fcntl` (Windows) or an unwritable state dir ⇒ the lock is a no-op and the id-dedupe stays the backstop, exactly as before. Sequential re-import was already idempotent; this closes the concurrent window.

- **`cage demo` is now idempotent.** Re-running `cage demo` used to append a *second* §4.4 worked example onto the same ledger, doubling `cage attrib`/`cage matrix` totals (82,800 tok vs the canonical 41,400). `demo.seed` now returns the existing call id and appends nothing when the demo task is already present — the tables reproduce §4.4 exactly however many times it runs.

- **`cage setup --project-only` scaffolds standalone.** Its `--help` promises "scaffold `.cage/` + graphify + PATH only", but with no agent flag it fell through to the "pick an agent" wiring path and no-op'd (scaffolding nothing). It now runs the agent-independent scaffold (`adoptcmd.run(..., surfaces=None)`) and stops; wiring an agent stays the separate, explicit `cage setup --wire-only --<agent>` step.

- **`cage export --json` added as an alias for `--format json`.** `cage report --json` worked but `cage export --json` errored with `unrecognized arguments`; the export summary is now reachable by the same flag both commands share.

## v0.15.0 — meter dedup correctness + `cage limits` (Codex quota + estimated AI-credits)

Two gaps closed, scoped tightly per a devil's-advocate/pre-mortem debate: a meter dedup correctness fix, and a new `cage limits` view for provider quota + token-derived **estimated** credits. Every credit/quota figure is labelled `estimated`, sourced, and reconcilable — a shape-mismatch yields *nothing*, never a wrong number. **Additive: no `CALL_FIELDS`/`make_call` change, no ledger rewrite, no new ledger substrate.**

- **Dedup correctness (defensive — disproven in practice, still landed).** `transcript._usage_to_row` no longer passes `call_id=None` for a Claude turn with no `uuid`; it derives a *deterministic* id from `(agent, session, model, tokens_in, tokens_out, cached_in, ts)` so a re-import dedupes in `hooks.append_new` instead of minting a random id each run. **Reproduce-first finding:** across 29,714 usage-bearing Claude turns in real transcripts, **zero** lacked a `uuid` — so this is a defensive close of the one random-id path, not a corrective fix. **uuid-present rows render byte-identical to before** (test-asserted). Old random-id duplicates already in a ledger are not healed by this change (a `--dedupe` compaction is a possible follow-on).

- **`cage limits` — provider quota + estimated AI-credits.** A new read view showing, per agent: Codex rate-limit windows (`remaining_pct` + reset time + snapshot age) and **estimated** AI-credit consumption (tokens × a per-model multiplier) for token-based providers only. Every figure is tagged `estimated`, names its source, and ends with a "reconcile against your provider dashboard" note. Kiro/Copilot credit numbers are **not** fabricated from tokens (units-of-work ≠ token multiples) — they show "—".

- **Codex quota is a latest-only state snapshot, NOT a ledger substrate.** `transcript._codex_rate_limits` reads the `rate_limits` block Codex already writes (probed against a real rollout: it's a *sibling* of `payload.info`, with `primary`/`secondary` windows — observed `10080`=weekly and `43200`=monthly, labels derived from `window_minutes`, not assumed). `limits.snapshot_codex` (called fail-open from `import_codex`) persists only the **latest** snapshot per `(agent, window)` to a machine-local `.cage/state/limits.json` — overwritten not appended, **never synced to refs/notes**. A renamed/missing block writes nothing, no error.

- **Credits multipliers ship OFF by default.** `[credits.<provider>."<model>"] per_mtok = N` in `policy.toml` (economics layer) drives a single tokens→credits dispatch (`credits.py`, mirroring `convert.saved_usd`). No active rows ship — only a commented example — because a wrong credit number is worse than none and the precise per-token rates aren't published; turn it on by setting `per_mtok` from your provider dashboard. Exact model-id match only (no family fallback — a borrowed estimate is a different wrong number); unknown multiplier ⇒ tokens only.

- **`cage.v1` JSON envelope.** `cage limits --json` emits a versioned `{"schemaVersion":"cage.v1","generatedAt":…,"command":…,"data":…}` envelope (one helper in `render.py`); `generatedAt` is wall-clock metadata, the `data` payload stays deterministic. Introduced here for `limits` only — a wider rollout is a separate packet.

No schema/contract (`CALL_FIELDS`/`make_call`), MCP tool contract, attribution/provenance engine, or `cage verify` exit-0 behavior changed. The dedup change is additive (id derivation only); quota/credits live outside the ledger entirely. 312 tests pass (was 299).

## v0.14.0 — typed CLI errors + a documented exit-code contract (fail-open preserved)

cage's error handling was already mature — ~64 fail-open markers on write paths, every broad `except` carrying a `# noqa: BLE001 — <reason>`, hooks all `try/except → exit 0`, and `main()` already mapping `KeyboardInterrupt → 130`. The one real gap: `main()` had no typed/expected-error path, so an expected failure (a malformed `policy.toml`) or any unexpected exception dumped a raw traceback. This release closes that gap — **additive and boundary-only; not one fail-open block was rewritten.**

- **One typed error.** New `cage/errors.py` = a thin `CageError(Exception)` (no hierarchy, no logging framework, no retries — stdlib only). It is for surfacing an expected, user-facing failure at the read/CLI boundary; it is never raised on a fail-open write path.

- **`cli.main()` renders cleanly.** Keeping `KeyboardInterrupt → 130`, it now maps `CageError → "error: <msg>"` + exit 1 (no traceback — it's an expected failure), and any other unexpected exception → terse `error: <msg>` + exit 1 with the **full traceback only under `CAGE_DEBUG=1`** (reusing the existing switch — no new env var).

- **Exit-code contract, documented + tested.** `0` ok · `1` error (`CageError`/unexpected) · `2` argparse usage error (stdlib default — e.g. an unknown subcommand) · `130` interrupted. `cage verify` stays report-only **exit 0** (never a build gate), unchanged.

- **One leak converted.** A malformed project `policy.toml` hit by a read command now surfaces as `error: policy.toml: <parse error>` (exit 1) instead of a `tomllib.TOMLDecodeError` traceback — converted at the single `_policy()` read chokepoint, leaving the policy layer itself untouched. `cage query <unknown>` and `cage why <bad-id>` were already clean; bad `--since`/`--scope` keep their existing exit-0 "no filter" behavior (no behavior change).

- **Fail-open verified, not rewritten.** New tests prove a forced internal error in `ledger.append` / `metering.meter` / the Stop hook never propagates, and that the swallow is reachable via `debuglog` (not truly silent). The audit found exactly one genuinely-silent broad swallow — `meter`'s cleanup — and it gets an **ADD-only** `CAGE_DEBUG` trace (the same pattern `hooks.py` already uses), fully guarded so the metered call's no-raise guarantee stays absolute. The MCP boundary was already crash-proof (`isError` on any tool error, malformed JSON lines skipped); tests now lock that in. 299 tests pass (was 284).

No schema/contract, MCP tool contract, metering/ledger/attribution/provenance engine logic, policy/constants layers, or four-agents wiring changed — only error *surfacing* at the boundary. MCP contract docs: N/A (behavior on malformed input is clarified, not changed). (This release also folds in the docs-only scrub of graphify from cage's marketing/lineage prose — code, the graphify meter/shim, and the worked example are unchanged.)

## v0.13.0 — skillgen: the flagship `cage` skill is rendered from one source

cage shipped the same flagship `cage` pitch four ways — a Claude/Codex slash-command `SKILL.md`, a Copilot `.prompt.md`, and a Kiro steering doc — hand-authored and free to drift. This release single-sources them.

- **`tools/skillgen/` (build-time, stdlib-only, never shipped).** A ~250-line renderer (`tomllib`/`re`/`pathlib`/`argparse` only — no runtime dependency, no LLM, no network) reads `fragments/core/core.md` plus a handful of per-host slots (frontmatter, header, intro framing, metering note) declared in `platforms.toml`, and renders every host's committed asset. `python -m tools.skillgen` renders, `--check` byte-diffs the render against both the committed files and `expected/` (exit 1 on drift), `--bless` refreshes `expected/`. Nothing under `tools/skillgen/` is imported by the `cage` package at runtime or packaged in the wheel (`[tool.setuptools.packages.find] include=["cage*"]` already excludes it; a test asserts it).

- **Five hosts, four sacred agents preserved.** Renders to the existing source paths so `cage setup` / `<agent>wire.py` keep working unchanged: `cage/data/skills/cage/SKILL.md` (Claude **and** Codex — they share one file, rendered byte-identical and asserted), `cage/data/prompts/cage.prompt.md` (Copilot), `cage/data/steering/cage.md` (Kiro), plus a **new** generic `cage/data/skills/agents/cage/SKILL.md` (Agent Skills) target to prove breadth. The four-agents invariant is test-asserted; editing one shared line in `core.md` updates every host in a single `--bless`.

- **Normalized shared body.** The three structurally-different wrappers (the Claude numbered runbook vs. the Copilot/Kiro bullet lists) now share one command block (`report`/`attrib`/`roi`/`matrix`/`budget`/`why`, `--json`) and one counts-never-content / PII-safe clause; only the frontmatter shape, header, intro framing, and metering note differ per host. Each host's `description` (its firing trigger) is preserved **verbatim** from `platforms.toml`.

- **Drift guard wired in.** `python -m tools.skillgen --check` runs in the `Python package` CI job and as a local `pre-commit` hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`). New tests (`tests/test_skillgen.py`) cover byte-determinism, all five hosts + the four sacred agents, per-host anchor lines, no surviving `@@` slot, `--check` clean/drift, the shared-path byte-identity guard, and wheel exclusion — 284 tests pass (was 262).

No schema/contract, MCP, metering/ledger/attribution/provenance, or `cage setup` behavior changed — only the *source* of the (reviewed-at-the-bless-gate) skill assets, plus the new generic `agents` asset. Design of record: [docs/skillgen.md](docs/skillgen.md).

## v0.12.1 — green CI: tests no longer depend on ambient git identity or pathlib internals

A bug-fix release: the `Python package` workflow was red on `main` (the publish workflow was unaffected — releases still shipped). Three `tests/test_ledger_scale.py` cases passed locally but failed on the CI matrix because they leaned on the developer's environment rather than asserting the contract:

- **Git-notes writes assumed a global git identity.** `test_ledger_sync_writes_under_env` and `test_team_read_uses_merged_ref` drive `ledgersync.sync(..., write=True)`, which shells `git notes add` through production's env-less `_git`. A dev machine has a global `user.email`/`user.name`; a CI runner has none, so the write failed and `wrote` came back `False`. The shared `_git_init` helper now pins identity **on the repo itself** (`git config user.email/user.name`), matching how CI configures the sole-writer — the tests are hermetic instead of borrowing ambient config.

- **A size-warning test clobbered global `pathlib.Path.stat`.** `test_size_warning_swallows_stat_error` monkeypatched `Path.stat` to raise, intending to prove the ledger-size byte-sum never breaks a read. On 3.14 `Path.exists()` doesn't route through `Path.stat`, so it passed; on the CI 3.11/3.12 it does, so the `OSError` escaped `ledger.read()`'s own `exists()` check (which the warning's try/except never covered) — and the wrong `boom()` signature even crashed pytest's traceback formatter. The byte-sum is now a discrete `ledger._shard_bytes(shards)` helper; the test patches *that* (version-independent), asserting the real contract: even a total failure to size the shards never perturbs the read.

No behavior change to any shipped surface — counts-never-content, determinism, and the $0/stdlib-only invariants are untouched; 262 tests pass across Python 3.11–3.13.

## v0.12.0 — universal capture: global ledger + explicit `import`/`export`

Capture was hook-led and project-local, and in the field that left whole classes of users uncaptured: hooks are client-specific and mostly don't fire (a VS Code extension never runs `.codex/hooks.json` / `.kiro/hooks/*.hook` / `~/.copilot/hooks` — only Claude Code's extension honors its hooks), and the importer no-oped outside a project `.cage/`. A Copilot-only user, or anyone in a VS Code extension, could run for days with an empty ledger and a `cage doctor` that cheerfully reported their unfireable hook as "capture wired." This release makes capture **pull-based and universal** — `cage import` (capture) and `cage export` (import-then-emit) are the canonical verbs over a **global ledger**, hooks are demoted to an optional real-time add-on, and **cage installs nothing in the background**.

**Global ledger + resolution.** One active sink per run, resolved `--ledger`/`CAGE_BASE` → nearest project `.cage/` from cwd → global `~/.cage` (`paths.resolve_root`/`active_ledger_source`). The global ledger mirrors a project `.cage/` (its own `ledger/`, `state/`, `policy.toml`), is month-partitioned like any other, and is created on first write or by **`cage setup --global`**. A user with no project now captures into `~/.cage` instead of getting a no-op; a hook firing in a random dir lands in the global ledger rather than scattering a stray local `.cage/` (the resolver prevents scatter, so the old cwd-`.cage` guard is gone). `--ledger DIR` re-bases the whole footprint via `CAGE_BASE`; the legacy `CAGE_LEDGER` (a ledger-*dir* override, e.g. Orff's elgar store) keeps its meaning, honored independently.

**`cage export`** runs import first (unless `--no-import`), prints `↻ imported N new call(s)` to stderr, then emits the active ledger: `--format jsonl` (raw rows, lossless/re-ingestable — the default), `csv` (flat, stdlib `csv`), or `json` (a structured summary whose totals match `cage report`). Honors `--since`/`--project`/`--agent` and `-o FILE` (else stdout). Counts-never-content (no prompt bodies); deterministic byte-identical output for the same `--since` window (rows emitted in ledger order); an empty ledger still yields a valid artifact (csv header / zero-total summary / no jsonl lines), never a crash.

**`project` field (the derived attribution axis).** An additive optional `project` field on the call record (empty = legacy contract, basename-only — the same PII guard as `scope`, which is untouched). Stamped on Claude imports from the transcript's `cwd` basename; Copilot/Kiro/Codex logs carry no cwd, so it stays empty for them (a named follow-up). `cage report --project <name>` (or `--project .`/bare = current dir) slices the global ledger to a project view — exact for Claude, and the output says so when other agents' projectless rows are excluded. Per-project *capture* is impossible for the non-Claude agents, so project is only ever a derived *view*, never a capture scope.

**`cage watch`** is an optional **foreground** poll loop: import every `--interval` seconds until Ctrl-C, a plain stdlib `sleep` (no filesystem-watch dependency). It registers nothing and stops with the terminal — **cage installs no OS scheduler** (no launchd/systemd/cron/schtasks, no `cage scheduler` command). Hands-off automation, if wanted, is the user's own cron line calling `cage import`, which `cage doctor` may mention but never creates.

**Incremental import (scale).** With no daemon, manual `cage import`, `export`'s refresh, and the `watch` loop are the hot paths; re-parsing every transcript and reloading the whole 22k+-row ledger per run is O(all logs × ledger). A per-agent high-water **cursor** (`.cage/state/cursors.json`, last-seen `(size, mtime)` per source file) skips unchanged files before parsing, and the ledger `seen` set is built once per run and shared across agents (`hooks.append_new` gained an optional shared `seen`); id-dedupe stays the correctness backstop. The cursor also stamps `_last_import`, surfaced as "last import: N ago".

**Honest `cage doctor`.** Infers each agent's capture state from the debug heartbeat (fired recently ⇒ real-time active; never ⇒ a *wired* hook is not a *firing* one — warns it won't fire under a VS Code extension); names the active ledger sink, shows "last import: N ago", and points at `cage import`/`cage export` as the universal path. No hook is labelled "capture wired"; there is no scheduler row.

Fail-open hardening on the capture path: a malformed `policy.toml` (e.g. a duplicate `[debug]` table that makes `tomllib` raise) now degrades to the bundled default with a recorded debug event, never a traceback. The substrate change is limited to the one additive `project` field (plan §3.1, §3.7); the attribution/matrix math and the §4.4 demo numbers are unchanged. 262 tests passing. See [docs/debugging-capture.md](docs/debugging-capture.md).

## v0.11.0 — observable capture (`CAGE_DEBUG`): per-hook heartbeat + recorded tracebacks

The capture path is fail-open and silent *everywhere* — every hook entrypoint and import wraps its work in `except Exception: pass`, and the skip-reason strings `importcmd.run` returns are discarded when a hook calls it (hook stdout goes nowhere). In the field this meant capture could silently do nothing for days across all four agents with no way to tell whether a hook even fired, whether the `.cage` cwd guard skipped it, or whether a parser raised — we diagnosed it only by hand-instrumenting hooks with marker files. This release bakes that observability in permanently, **without changing capture**: it is strictly observational (a logging error is swallowed, the ledger is never touched, no hook is ever blocked), off by default, and metadata-only.

New `cage/debuglog.py` (stdlib, $0) writes one structured JSON line per capture event to `.cage/state/debug.log`, gated by `policy.debug_enabled` — env `CAGE_DEBUG=1` overrides `policy.toml [debug] enabled` (default **off**). When off, no file is written and the only added cost is one tiny policy read per hook firing; **the ledger is byte-identical with debug on or off** (the log is local state, never read by a derived view, so determinism holds). It records agent, event, cwd, resolved root, `.cage` present?, capture-enabled?, `transcript_path` *presence* (a bool, never contents), files scanned, rows parsed/appended/deduped, the exact skip reason, and — the core fix — every previously-swallowed exception's **type + traceback** instead of letting it vanish. Counts-never-content still holds: no prompt/response bodies, no token text.

Every hook entrypoint (`session_start`/`stop`/`session_end`/`post_tool_use`/`post_commit`) and the umbrella `importcmd.run` + each adapter (`import_claude`/`codex`/`copilot`/`kiro`) is instrumented, so all four agents are first-class. Each firing also stamps a **per-`(agent,event)` heartbeat** to `.cage/state/hooks-seen.jsonl` (append-only, last-write-wins on read), which finally answers "did this agent's hook ever fire?" without manual marker files. `cage doctor` gains a `trace` row: with debug off it says how to turn it on; with debug on it shows, per agent, the last hook fired (event + how long ago, or `never fired`) plus the last skip/error. New `cage debug [--tail N]` prints recent events. Skips are recorded with stable, greppable codes — `skip=no-cage`, `skip=capture-disabled`, `skip=since-filtered` (the last fires when `--since` dropped every candidate file, a common "why is nothing captured?" cause). To observe a hook firing in a dir that has no `.cage/`, point `CAGE_DEBUG_LOG` at a fixed file — debug logging never *creates* a `.cage/` footprint (which `find_project_root` would then mistake for a project). Enable with `CAGE_DEBUG=1`; see [docs/debugging-capture.md](docs/debugging-capture.md) (and the short section in `docs/agents.md`).

Also in this release: **`cage` exits cleanly on Ctrl-C** instead of dumping a `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback — aborting the `cage setup` wizard (or any command) now prints `aborted.` and returns 130.

## v0.10.2 — Kiro hook format fixed (it never fired before)

Kiro's Agent Hook file is **one hook per file** — the file *is* the hook object (`{name, version, description, when:{type}, then:{type, command}}`), not the `{"version":"v1","hooks":[…]}` container with `trigger`/`action` keys that Cage was writing. That wrong shape (plus a `SessionStart` trigger **Kiro doesn't have** — its events are `agentStop`/`promptSubmit`/`pre|postToolUse`/`file*`/`pre|postTaskExecution`/manual) meant the Kiro hook silently never ran. `cage setup` now writes a single **`agentStop`** hook in the correct format; because each fire re-imports Kiro's whole usage log (deduped by call id), that one hook is both the real-time and the backfill path — the next turn covers anything the prior one missed (the same self-backfilling pattern Copilot uses). The file is cage-owned, so re-running setup overwrites it wholesale and heals any old-format install. Re-run `cage setup --wire-only` to pick up the working hook.

## v0.10.1 — release process codified: GitHub release is the publish trigger, never publish from local

Releases now ship a **GitHub release**, and the GitHub release *is* the PyPI publish: creating it fires `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (`on: release: published`), which builds and uploads via **OIDC trusted publishing** (no stored token, nothing to leak). The one true flow — bump `__version__` + changelog, push `main`, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the tag, `gh release create vX.Y.Z` — is now a durable rule in `CLAUDE.md`. **No more `uv publish`/`twine` from a laptop;** CI is the sole publisher (`skip-existing: true` keeps it idempotent). A version on PyPI with no matching GitHub release/tag is a release bug.

## v0.10.0 — real-time per-turn capture (Stop hook), repo-level skills, `state/` gitignored

Claude Code **and Codex** spend now lands *as each turn ends*, not only when you open the next chat. For Claude, `cage setup` wires a **Stop** hook (`cage hook-stop`) that imports the just-finished turn from the live transcript; for Codex it wires a turn-scoped **Stop** hook in `.codex/hooks.json` that re-imports the rollouts Codex writes to disk. Both are idempotent (deduped by call id / turn uuid), so they stack safely on top of the SessionStart-backfill safety net and (Claude) the best-effort SessionEnd. Before this, the only reliable trigger was the *next* session's SessionStart-backfill, so a session's tokens stayed "pending" until you started a new chat. `cage doctor`'s metering matrix now shows `real-time Stop + backfill ✔` for both log-bearing agents.

**Copilot CLI is now metered too** — it persists a per-session usage log (`~/.copilot/session-state/*/events.jsonl`, whose `session.shutdown` event carries `modelMetrics`), so `cage import --agent copilot` records its spend (per-model usage nests under `modelMetrics.<model>.usage`; on this machine Copilot runs `claude-haiku-4.5`) and `cage setup` wires `agentStop`/`sessionStart`/`sessionEnd` hooks at the **user level** (`~/.copilot/hooks/cage.json` — verified the only location the local CLI fires from; repo `.github/hooks/` does not fire even when committed), moving Copilot off proxy-only onto a real import path. Because Copilot writes its `session.shutdown` (the usage) *after* its own hooks fire, a session's tokens land on the **next** Copilot run — its `sessionStart`/`agentStop` import picks up the prior session's shutdown (the standard backfill pattern; cage never sweeps another agent's data from a hook).

**Kiro is now metered too, completing the four-agent set** — Kiro persists a coarse usage log (`kiro.kiroagent/dev_data/tokens_generated.jsonl`: one object per call, prompt tokens reliable, output often 0, model the generic `"agent"`) and supports Agent Hooks, so `cage setup` wires a real-time **Stop** Agent Hook (`.kiro/hooks/cage.kiro.hook` → `cage import --agent kiro`) and `cage import --agent kiro` records it. With this, **every surface in `agents.SURFACES` is now log-bearing** — none is proxy-only. And the hook coverage is now **symmetric across all four**: each agent gets both a real-time per-turn hook (Claude/Codex/Kiro `Stop`, Copilot `agentStop`) *and* a SessionStart-style backfill safety net, so `cage doctor`'s matrix reads `real-time Stop + backfill ✔` for every one.

**Hooks and MCP servers are now wired with the *resolved absolute* `cage` path, not a bare `cage`** — GUI-launched agents (the Kiro IDE, the Copilot extension, a Codex app) run hooks with a minimal PATH that omits `~/.local/bin`, so a bare `cage` failed silently with "command not found" and nothing was captured (only Claude Code, terminal-launched, worked). `cage setup` now resolves the binary at wire time and **heals** an existing bare-`cage` install in place (no duplicate entries) — re-run `cage setup` once to upgrade.

**Each agent's hook imports only its own log** (`cage import --agent <itself>`) — cage never sweeps another agent's data from a hook, so capture stays scoped and predictable (re-running setup migrates any older all-agent-sweep command back to the per-agent import). The `cage setup` wizard now **defaults to setting up *all* agents** (`cage setup --all` non-interactively) rather than making you pick one — wiring every agent is a single step. Internally, agent wiring is now **one `<agent>wire.py` per agent** (`claudewire`/`codexwire`/`copilotwire`/`kirowire`, each exposing `install`/`status`/`backfill_status`/`realtime_status`), dispatched from `agents.py` — a standing convention so integrating a new agent means adding one wire file, nothing more.

Finally, a **consumer on/off switch for auto-capture**: `[capture] enabled = false` in `policy.toml` (or `CAGE_CAPTURE=0`, which overrides policy) makes the hook-driven `cage import` a no-op — pause metering without unwiring any hooks; `CAGE_CAPTURE=1` forces it back on for a single run. The proxy stays the higher-fidelity fallback where Kiro's log is too thin.

**Pricing refreshed for all four agents' models** — the bundled `policy.toml` now carries current Anthropic rates (Opus 4.8 corrected from a stale $15/$75 to $5/$25; Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5) for Claude Code + Kiro, and the OpenAI `gpt-5` family (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.3-codex`) for Codex + Copilot, so their traffic costs out instead of reading `UNPRICED`. Two Codex metering bugs fixed in the same pass: the model id (declared once in a `turn_context` record) is now carried onto the usage events instead of coming through empty, and per-turn usage reads `last_token_usage` instead of summing the cumulative `total_token_usage` — which had inflated a real ~12M-token session to a bogus 210M.

**The /cage skill can now be installed repo-level instead of machine-wide** — `cage setup --repo-skill` (or pick "project" in the wizard) writes the skill into the repo (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.github/prompts/`, `.kiro/steering/`) so it's committed and the whole team gets it, with nothing in your home dir; global stays the default. Also: the `.cage/.gitignore` now excludes `state/` (machine-local hook buffers — pending edits, session state), and `cage init`/`cage setup` heals older footprints that were missing it. Re-run `cage setup --wire-only` in an existing project to pick up the Stop hook.

## v0.9.0 — ledger scale: partitions, scope, team aggregation

The ledger now survives heavy/multi-dev/monorepo use. Writers append to month-partitioned shards (`calls-YYYY-MM.jsonl`, same for receipts/tasks) chosen from each row's own `ts`; readers glob + concatenate (legacy single files still read), and `--since` skips whole below-cutoff months instead of re-scanning a year. Calls/receipts carry an optional counts-safe `scope` (top-level changed dir, same PII guard as tasks); `report`/`attrib`/`budget`/`matrix --scope <dir>` slice a monorepo component (no flag ⇒ byte-identical). `cage ledger-sync` distributes local rows into `refs/notes/cage-ledger` (dry-run by default, CI-sole-writer like `notes-sync`), and `report`/`attrib --team` read the merged team view (falling back to local when empty) — rolled up by `scope`, never per-person. A one-line stderr warning fires when the ledger crosses a derived size (≈2 heavy solo-years; `[ledger] warn_mb` overrides) — warn-only, never blocks a derive.

Also in this release: **reliable hookless capture is now the default** — `cage setup` wires a **SessionStart-backfill** for the two transcript agents (Claude Code's `.claude/settings.json` and Codex's `.codex/hooks.json`, which share a hook schema) that imports the *previous* session on the next start, ordered before the spend banner. SessionEnd stays wired but is best-effort (it never fires on a killed/crashed/idle session); running both is safe because `cage import` dedupes by call id. Copilot/Kiro have no transcript, so their reliable path stays the proxy. `cage doctor`'s metering matrix now names the mechanism actually wired per agent (SessionStart-backfill / SessionEnd / proxy) and flags any log-bearing agent left without a reliable trigger. All four agents stay first-class.

## v0.8.0 — one hookless front door for all four agents

`cage import [--agent claude|codex|copilot|kiro|all]` (default `all`) unifies hookless metering: Claude Code and Codex import the usage transcripts they write to disk, while Copilot and Kiro — which expose no usage log — print their supported proxy fallback (`cage meter -- <cmd>`) instead of being silently skipped. Additive to hooks/MCP and deduped by call id (a turn seen by both a hook and an import counts once); the old `import-claude`/`import-codex` stay as aliases. `cage doctor` now renders a four-agent metering matrix (hook / import / proxy per agent).

## v0.7.1 — docs + the four-agents invariant

README "What's new" and test counts brought current, and a durable rule recorded for every agent (`CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md`): Cage keeps **Claude Code · Codex · Copilot · Kiro** first-class on every surface, and each release must update this changelog.

## v0.7.0 — one front door + hookless metering

`cage setup` is now the single onboarding command: `--project-only` (scaffold + graphify, no global skill), `--wire-only` (agent wiring only), and `--status` (report wiring) absorb the old `adopt`/`hooks` verbs, which are gone. Internal `hook-*` entrypoints are hidden from `--help`. Ships alongside hookless transcript metering (`cage import-claude`), a per-call pricing fallback, and the bare-`cage` spent-and-saved headline. All four agents (Claude Code · Codex · Copilot · Kiro) stay first-class.

## v0.6.0 — authorship attribution

`cage origin <sha>` answers *who wrote which files in which commit* — a fourth append-only record captured by a `PostToolUse` hook (transcript fallback), with `hooked`/`transcript`/`heuristic` method ranks and `human`/`agent`/`agent-autonomous` origins. `unknown` is read-derived from absence, never a stored row; `origin=human` only via explicit attestation. Distributed over `refs/notes/cage-provenance` (CI is the sole writer); `cage verify` is report-only and never gates the build.

## v0.5.0 — DX + concept explainers

A constants/query-help layer and `cage query` concept topics: ask *how cage works*, not just *how a number is computed*, all deterministic and `$0`.

## v0.3.0 — the Tier-1 human axis

`cage human` / `cage trend` price agent-vs-human in **dollars and hours**, anchored to a git-aware task record; a `minutes` unit, a `[human]` rate table with confidence laddering, and `CAGE_HUMAN_RATE`. Third-party tools join via the external adapter (`cage graphify`).

## v0.2.0 — attribution + the counterfactual matrix

Marginal-by-fixed-order attribution, the 2ⁿ permutation table, ROI per tool, and the `measured`/`modeled`/`estimated` discipline — the differentiator.

## v0.1.0 — substrate + meter

The call/receipt contract, the append-only ledger, `policy.toml`, and `cage report`.
