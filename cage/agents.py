"""Multi-agent integration orchestrator (plan §5, §6, §9.5-6).

One ledger contract, four surfaces. Cage targets the wire protocol, so the *meter*
is universal (transcript import) and the *read* surface is universal (MCP) — each agent
has **its own wire file** that wires that agent's idiomatic config to those universals:

  claude  → claudewire.py   (.claude/settings.json hooks + .mcp.json)
  codex   → codexwire.py    (.codex/hooks.json + ~/.codex/config.toml MCP server)
  copilot → copilotwire.py  (~/.copilot/hooks/cage.json + .vscode/mcp.json + instructions)
  kiro    → kirowire.py     (.kiro/hooks/cage.kiro.hook + .kiro/settings/mcp.json + steering)

**Convention: one `<agent>wire.py` per agent** — a new agent gets its own wire file
exposing `install` / `status` / `backfill_status` / `realtime_status`, and is added to
`SURFACES` + the dispatch maps below. Each agent's hook imports **only its own** on-disk
log (`cage import --agent <itself>`) — cage never sweeps another agent's data from a hook.
